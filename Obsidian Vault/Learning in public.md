This digital garden is my third try at producing unfinished content and publish to the web.

The Scrapbox digital garden is more like a notebook. The pages I scribbled have remained untouched. I don't see and I lost interest in growing them. The key difference between that and I'm doing right now is that it's a work in-progress being edited on the web. It's like writing a chapter for a story while the platform you're using says "Published." Readers have a couple of paragraphs but the story suddenly stops.

I didn't understand the idea of "building with the garage door up" until now. I thought it was cool until I started writing the [[index]] of this digital garden. I am, or was, absolutely terrifed of putting this out there.

It's like performing an unfinished song.

It's like publishing a draft that hasn't reached it's intended end.

Very much this page.

- [[Self-hosting my Digital Garden with Github, and perhaps Tiddlywiki]] is a reflection on digital gardens. It has tons of links and references to other gardeners such as [Tom Critchlow](https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow), [Maggie Appleton](https://twitter.com/Mappletons), and [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://twitter.com/anthilemoon).
- [[My First Digital Garden, a Web Development Project]] is an overview of this project with a project description and checkbox section. Feel free to tweak it to your digital gardening needs!
