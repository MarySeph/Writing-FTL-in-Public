# Mind Garden Experiment using Thoughts On Notes

---

These are not interlinked, whoops. Yeah, that was the problem I ran in [[Scrapbox]]. Does it matter? Yes, it does. Why? Because I want to use the bi-directional linking feature. It's very important. It's what makes a digital garden so fun to use. It's like a snapshot of the person's thinking model. I should at least link these notes. Somehow.

The topic of this mind garden needs to be something I'm passionate about. A digital garden is similar to a blog, but it's not as polished. I'm sure I have content that could become a digital garden. Going meta would be [so confusing]([[Self-hosting my Digital Garden with Github, and perhaps Tiddlywiki]]).

Another option is to make a digital garden of my current story. It's like homework. You need to choose a topic and make a digital out of it. Actually, that sounds quite nice.

**Choose a theme and make a digital garden out of it. This is important homework. You have three days. Have it by Friday.

Actually, I already have it. It's [[Obsidian Demo-v2.5]] on GitHub.
- Deploy through [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- Host repo on [[GithubPages]]
- [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/#GettingStarted) for back end and appearance and generating the static website (HTML and CSS)
- Features:
	**- Bi-directional linking**
	~~- Hover pop-ups~~
	- Name
	- Central index (https://www.gwern.net/index)
	~~- Visual node graph (https://wiki.nikiv.dev/); [Obsidian](https://twitter.com/obsdmd)~~

Based on [Maggie Appleton's post](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), your digital garden can have these qualities:
1. pages are linked through a connection of ideas, not by date.
	- No "Most recent" or "Latest" feed at index
		- optional:
			- Central index (https://www.gwern.net/index)
			- Search bar
			- Visual node graph (https://wiki.nikiv.dev/); [Obsidian](https://twitter.com/obsdmd).
2. room for growth and development
3. learn in public, you are a novice
	- optional metadata:
		- topics
		- dates (created and last edited)
		- stage (seedling, budding, evergreen)
4. personal and experimental
5. diverse types of content
	- text
	- tweets ^a95964
	- images
	- videos
	- audio
	- etc
6. you must own it
	- use open-source software
		- Github
		- Jekyll
		- Hugo
		- etc
	- web native languages
		- HTML
		- CSS
		- Markdown
