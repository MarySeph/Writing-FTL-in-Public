# Keima asks the senpai to get lunch together.
Keima asks the senpai to get lunch together. He asks the senpai since when did he know he liked guys and the senpai confesses he had been dating for quite a while outside of school and goes on a ramble about the other guys in his year that seemed 'off.'

(The senpai had arrived the year before for vacations bc he's taken a gap year and decided to stay and study. His English is fucking good. At the place he was helping out, he met his current partner who introduced him to this college. Happy couple happy couple~)

Keima recalls he hadn't congratulated his senpai for the relationship and does just that. The senpai kindly takes the words and asks about his relationship status.

The senpai then asks why did Keima decided to leave the country to study abroad. Keima takes a moment to answer, saying he decided to come with Kiyoshi.

In response, the senpai asks if Keima is gay. Keima stiffens and denies it. He wavers before saying he's asexual. The senpai says he doesn't know what that is and Keima explains it's the lack of sexual (and romantic) attraction. The senpai asks if that means Keima is going to stay single. Keima begrudgingly asserts. The senpai says he was always surrounded with friends so he can see how Keima never felt the need to have a partner.
