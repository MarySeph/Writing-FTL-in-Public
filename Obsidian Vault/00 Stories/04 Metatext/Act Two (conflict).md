# Act Two (conflict)
Act Two (conflict)
The second act is full of conflict.

Character development is crucial in the second act; the hero at the end of Act One does not yet have the tools (whether those tools be emotional, physical or literal items the hero must retrieve) to succeed in the third act, so Act Two is all about the journey.
