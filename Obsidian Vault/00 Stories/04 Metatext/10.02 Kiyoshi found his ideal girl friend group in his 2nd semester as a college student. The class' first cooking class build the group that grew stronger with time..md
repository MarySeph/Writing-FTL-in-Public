Kiyoshi found his ideal girl friend group in his 2nd semester as a college student. The class' first cooking class build the group that grew stronger with time.

The class was mostly people who identified as girls. They are outspoken, most of them. Most importantly they are outspoken about their thoyghts and feelings and include Kiyoshi in conversation about relationships and attraction.

He sometimes gets ordered around too 😌. It was a bit of a bad habit because Kiyoshi is obedient and nice but it faded as they got to like him. Cooking in a common topic and they have inside jokes. They are very affectionate as well. Most of the people are from a latinamerican country, including their Mexican cooking professor. There's also quite a few Asian such as from India and from Middle Eastern countries.

Basically Asia 👏 Latin America
