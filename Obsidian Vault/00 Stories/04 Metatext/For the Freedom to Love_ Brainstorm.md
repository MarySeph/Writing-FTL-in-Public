# What topics do I want to cover?

1. Gender

Kiyoshi's search for and his eventual acceptance of his gender identity and expression.

- He had experimented in the past with cross-dressing.
- With encouragement, he gathers the courage to look for clothes he likes. He bumps into Theo who, like a god send, finds exactly what he's into and buys some outfits.
- Keima is absolutely supportive of Kiyoshi.
- He returns to that store and buys some pink underwear. Keima goes insane about them.
- Then Kiyoshi buys a pink nightgown

- Keima's breakdown of his masculine identity and building himself backup.

- Deconstruction of the hetero-normative, sexist, and limiting dynamics in romantic relationships. In this case, same-sex relationships.

- Keima as the masculine and Kiyoshi as the feminine; Keima as the top and Kiyoshi as the bottom.

- Search for a healthier alternative that reflects them, makes them comfortable and allows freedom, change, communication, and love.

2. Sexuality

- Kinks as a liberating experience and safe space for exploration and self-expression.

- Deconstruction of the hetero-normative, sexist, and limiting dynamics in romantic relationships. In this case, same-sex relationships.

- Keima as the top and Kiyoshi as the bottom.

- Search for a healthier alternative that reflects them, makes them comfortable and allows exploration, change, communication, and love.

- Kiyoshi and Keima's evolving relationship with their romantic and sexual attraction.

- Keima learns that labels *shouldn't* be restrictive; doing this or that doesn't make him any less asexual.

- He used to constantly feel anxiety over his increasing libido and changing attraction towards Kiyoshi, policing himself over what's asexual or not.

- Kiyoshi abandons labels altogether. The search becomes meaningless. He's just Kiyoshi. His type is 'nice,' gender be damned! He shares this lesson with Keima.

3. Mental Health

- Kiyoshi's struggle with GAD and social anxiety, and the support he gets from the people around him.
- Keima's loss of identity and its repercussions on his mental health: low self-esteem/worth, depression, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, short hospitalization, therapy, and reconstruction from the ground up.

4. Relationships

- The everyday tug of wag to keep a romantic relationship strong.
- The effort to communicate and find common ground.
- The love to lift each other up during tumultuous time.

5. Personal development

- The desire to overcome and face challenges (trauma, bad habits, health problems, or just goals) and the motivation behind them.

## What mood do I want the story to have?

A lot of wholesome moments between Keima and Kiyoshi, both lighthearted and meaningful.

- Particularly how hella supportive they are of each other TAT.
- When the plots kick in, it can have their lows and emotional moments.
- One of the key messages of the story is that accepting support and love is the strength to overcome all obstacles.

## What inspired me to write this story?

Keima and Kiyoshi are a couple that have faced a lot of challenges. These have helped them grow. They teach me that relationships are like a garden, they need to be cared for everyday. Without this care, they can dry out and sometimes they get sick which requires even stricter and constant care. What makes them worth the effort is the beautiful moments of vulnerability and mutual growth that change their lives.

## High-end Summary of Events

1. Kiyoshi's trauma resurfaces during Spring semester. Lian learns about it. Kiyoshi copes with seeking multiple partners without Keima's knowledge.
2. Kiyoshi and Keima move into their own apartment, starting their lives together.
3. During lockdown, Keima's pressure to please Kiyoshi as a man ought to do makes him crumble. He starts seeking therapy and falls into a deep depression that lasts several months. As he gets better, he finds among Kiyoshi's latest obsession (donghua) that submissive masculinity is possible. Keima starts performing as a house husband and submissive partner. This puts an all-new pressure on Kiyoshi who has a visceral disgust about topping. He eventually communicates that it reminds him of Houjo.
4. During their trip to Japan, Keima faces his mother's change, a concern that Keima won't be able to get married. While Keima considers proposing to Kiyoshi, he realizes Kiyoshi's trust wasn't as solid as he believed because Kiyoshi didn't confide in him about Houjo apart from the first time.
5. Kiyoshi does get over his trauma with the help of Philosophy.
6. Keima's reconstruction of a masculinity that is true to himself leads him to the conclusion that breaking the rules he had set up from the ones that were given to him allowed both Keima and Kiyoshi the freedom to love each other without boundaries but the ones they set themselves.
- **THE END***

While the story ought to end with Kiyoshi and Keima returning to Japan and Kiyoshi starting to search for a wife to start a family, it will most likely end before that. Perhaps after Keima is comfortable with his own version of masculinity.

- I think that in the last arc, Keima's, there will be porn with plot. Sex will be a big thing, but it can't be solely smut. Porn with plot is the base line, by the way. I probably can get away with porn but it would be embarrassing so I gotta think outside the box. Their lovemaking is more than two people having sex, it's Keima exploring and regaining confidence in his manhood and himself. Perhaps the sex acts don't have to be defined, instead focusing on the internal world and some general details. Sort of like in La Peste from Saramango. Something like:
	- Keima squeezed his thighs around Kiyoshi's neck as his partner's fingers reached deep inside. He melted under Kiyoshi's warm words, dearingly calling him pup and saying what he was doing a good job at. The roleplay was a safe space to show vulnerability, giving Kiyoshi permission to smother him. Giving and receiving pleasure wasn't a matter of responsibility anymore. Kiyoshi, with his flexible ideas of gender, opened intimacy to a flow of passion, love, and care. It wasn't one sided, it was a constant pulse between their bodies, it had ebb and flow. Breaking the rules made them truly free to love, choosing to love the other and allowing themselves to be loved.
	- After they were spent and clean, sharing a warm bath filled with chaste hugs and kisses, they put on their cotton pajamas and made dinner together.
- I guess another thing would be discussing kinks, fetishes and role plays:
	- Such as Theo and Kiyo's discussion about ways to spice sex life. Or Lian and Kei's kinky bingo.
- Kiyoshi and Keima's discussion would be polite and intimate conversations about their preferences and sharing ideas for future sexual moments.
- Keima's post-orgasm expression was a one-in-a-million view that Kiyoshi had a front seat to. He was so unguarded and vulnerable as if he had a dream about being born. No pressure from society, peers, and mothers. Until recently, Kiyoshi was under the impression Keima was inside the same as outside, optimistic, caring, and adventurous. Life threw him a curve ball and pulled off his misconception by the roots. His boyfriend was carrying a burden heavier than Kiyoshi could have fathomed, even then, he would believe it was lighter than it seemed if Keima did the work with a carefree smile.
- Keima grabbed Kiyoshi's arm and pulled him in, burrowing his face on Kiyoshi's bare chest. His breathing was peaceful and steady, bushy brows relaxed like llamas chilling on the mountains. Keima's arm hung limp across Kiyoshi's waist.
- They have had sex so many times, so Kiyoshi was positive Keima had never acted like this before. So bare, so raw. Kiyoshi's eyes stung. In front of him was the most precious thing in the world, his boyfriend's complete trust. Compared to every other pearl, this one was tiny, a mere speck of fading time. Until it lasted, in his mortal imperfect memory, it would be Kiyoshi's most precious treasure.

Yeap, that's pretty good. Add some plot and nice feels baby~ Keima's arc is all about intimacy and regaining self-esteem by finding his own ideas of masculinity. while not all is sexual intimacy, Keima trying to bottom and finding his submissive side is pretty important to his character development, as well as Kiyoshi's.

Perhaps instead of a novel, I should tell this story in smaller pieces, such as one long chapter or an "arc." Perhaps a novella; a self-contained story in a bigger world.

I think I should write a draft before posting. Just to entertain myself with writing and not have pressures from social media and the like.

## Self-contained arcs:

- Kiyoshi's exploration of his gender expression and identity.
- Keima's breakdown and healing.
- Trip to Japan; reconciling with their past.
