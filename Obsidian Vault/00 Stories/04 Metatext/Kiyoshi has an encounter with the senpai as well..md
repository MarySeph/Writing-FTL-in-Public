# Kiyoshi has an encounter with the senpai as well.
Kiyoshi has an encounter with the senpai as well. The senpai is a little distant, and Kiyoshi recalls the spark he felt between them. Him being gay made SO much sense now. Kiyoshi hadn't started therapy by that time so he told himself it was just his imagination bc they became distant soon after. Kiyoshi keeps a positive impression of his senpai anyways.
