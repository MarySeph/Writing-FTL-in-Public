Keima bumps into a senpai from HS. They catch up and he tells Keima he was gay all along as his boyfriend (a white dude) pops in for a sec.

Keima is stunned and his body language is awkward. The senpai reads the air and decides to leave but Keima stops him, asking if he wants to meet the other Japanese guys he knows. The senpai refuses and Keima insists on at least saving each other's contact number
