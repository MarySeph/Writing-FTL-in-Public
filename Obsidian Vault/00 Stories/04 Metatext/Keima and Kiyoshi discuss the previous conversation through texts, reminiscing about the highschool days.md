# Keima and Kiyoshi discuss the previous conversation through texts, reminiscing about the highschool days.
Keima and Kiyoshi discuss the previous conversation through texts, reminiscing about the highschool days. They joke around until Keima gets defensive when Kiyoshi says he 'came out' to senpai, apologizing soon after, but Kiyoshi doesn't reply anymore.
