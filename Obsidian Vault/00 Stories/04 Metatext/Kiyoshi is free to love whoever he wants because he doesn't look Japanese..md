# Kiyoshi is free to love whoever he wants because he doesn't look Japanese.
Kiyoshi is free to love whoever he wants because he doesn't look Japanese.

(Keima believes this because Kiyoshi told him he had come out to another model (that he had a boyfriend) who let Kiyoshi off the hook bc he looked Western ("foreigners sure work different huh?"))

Keima believes that non-Japanese-looking people, because they pass as foreigners, don't have to follow Japanese social norms. (Thus not being heterosexual is okay.)
