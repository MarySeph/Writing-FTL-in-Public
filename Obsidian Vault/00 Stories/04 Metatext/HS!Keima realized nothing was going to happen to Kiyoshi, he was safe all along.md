# HS!Keima realized nothing was going to happen to Kiyoshi, he was safe all along.
HS!Keima realized nothing was going to happen to Kiyoshi, he was safe all along. Yet, he was still doing it. It was after an argument with his mother that Keima realized he was protecting himself. Kiyoshi could be with whoever the fuck he wanted, but Keima was pressured to follow Japanese customs, the one his mother was forcing on him (hetero-normativity).
