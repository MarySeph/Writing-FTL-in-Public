This. Was. A. ***FIRST!***

Kiyoshi steadied his expression, heartbeat erratic, as they turned around a corner. A crowd had gathered, nearby tables holding cups and refreshments.

"Hello there, here for the International students' meetup?"

Kiyoshi jumped, turning to the voice. "Ah, hai. Yes, we are."

"Awesome! We'll be starting soon. Go ahead."

The grip around his hand tightened. Keima wore a ghastly expression. Teeth clenched, he breathed in till his chest swelled, hand cold and sweaty.

Kiyoshi waited for him to take the first step, but seconds passed and Kei didn't move at all. Inserting between him and the crowd, Kiyoshi mustered a gentle, decisive tone. "There's no shame in not holding hands. It's okay."

Keima lifted his head, staring at Kiyoshi like a lost puppy. An image of a younger Keima superimposed the sight.

"Sorry. I'm sorry, Kiyoshi." The attendant was still nearby, and people were passing by. Even so, Kiyoshi wanted to pet his brown mane and do more.

The heat from Keima's palm left. "Kei, it's okay," Kiyoshi cooed, plastering a supportive smile. "Things are done one step at a time."

Keima growled. "Damn, this isn't the time!" He ruffled his head and faced forward. "Let's go."

——

After the welcome speech, the group moved to a roofless, open area. Kiyoshi fidgeted, looking around as the group organized. "Um, Kei, can we hold hands?"

Jade green eyes quivered, lips setting in a thin line. "Sure." The brush of their intertwining fingers made electricity curse through Kiyoshi's skin.

Keima tightened their grip, tearing a gasp out of Kiyoshi. Making a V sign, he leaned against his boyfriend as he pulled his lips upwards.

One of the photographers spoke. "Thanks for coming everyone! Enjoy the rest of your day! Don’t—"

The people around them erupted into cheers. The bright, late-summer sun illuminated their expressions. Their unique facial features and unintelligible words vaguely resembled Western films. It was a strange feeling, having something in common with people you don’t know anything about.

Kiyoshi and Keima hopped from group to group, introducing themselves to other students. Eventually, they agreed to rest on a nearby seat.

Kiyoshi hunched over, holding his throbbing head. The chatter he found pleasant an hour ago now ground his gears. He told his companion he was going inside the building and dragged himself away.

The cold air from the air conditioning was soothing. Kiyoshi plopped on one of the couches and closed his eyes.

When his headache lessened, Kiyoshi pulled out his phone, adding the next event to his calendar. He had just muted the notifications from a new LINE group when his eye caught two colorful fliers.

One was an invitation to the LBGT club and the other to Bible study. His lip twitched at the irony, recalling his father’s thoughts on Christianity. He took individual pictures of the fliers, sending the first to Kei and both to his dad.

——

On the circular table, three people chatted in half English and half another language. Were they in a class together? Roommates?

His trepidation started when his mother asked if he had set foot in a kitchen. Her tone made his stomach twist, so when a student offered to build a cooking club, Kiyoshi agreed.

"Um, could we, start the meeting already?"

The group went silent. Were their burning gazes locked on him, or was it a figment of his imagination? Kiyoshi sweltered, the sight of the table blurring at the edges.

The one that invited him to the group blurted senseless words. His body went stiff. The leader, due to his silence, turned to the other members. The person at Kiyoshi's side answered in his stead.

Somehow, he survived another hour around them. His embarrassing attempts at communicating burned like an open wound. The more he repeated himself, the more his anxiety rose. Every time he opened his mouth, the mood turned awkward.

When he saw the girls taking the nearby elevator, he dashed to the toilet and sobbed. Stress flowed out of his body like running water, and he calmed down after a few minutes.

Taking one of the stone paths, a vast grassland filled his vision. Above, there was a lake. On the horizon were the biggest, prettiest, and fanciest lake houses he had ever seen. Like an eel peeking out of its hiding place, the urge to run down the slope at top speed resurfaced. He imagined the cool air caressing his cheeks, sprinting until his lungs were about to burst.

Kiyoshi tore his gaze away. 'Focus! Just because I'm having trouble talking to people doesn't mean I—'

A cat jumped on a nearby table. Kiyoshi closed in, extending a finger towards its glossy black fur.

The cat trotted away without acknowledging his presence. Kiyoshi followed it with a blank expression until it was out of sight.

The way back to the dorm was never-ending. He considered dropping out of the initiative, but the smoky black shadow stretched, hovering like an apparition. Kiyoshi halted on instinct, and with it any gutless plans.

——

Lian's bright smile and warm greeting were a beacon of light. His nerves disentangled a tad, and he let out a long steady breath. Then, mind catching up to the body, his cheeks flushed.

Fortunately, Lian didn't show signs he noticed—or chose to ignore it—asking about the meeting with the other Culinary Arts students.

Kiyoshi turned away. "Mn, it was okay." He dropped his bag beside the bed and promptly fell on the mattress, cuddling the pillow. "Super tired. Many thoughts. Many people." He sighed through his nose. "Girls. . ."

Lian's voice felt closer, softer. "Want me to bring you dinner from the caf?"

"Uhn, thank you."

Compared to the people he just talked to, Lian's company was like laying on wool. The resistance was just enough to keep Kiyoshi in place. And that fateful day, it was as secure as Kei's with a marshmallow softness. Perhaps that's what people mean when saying 'a mother's embrace.' Although to be more accurate, Lian would be an older brother.

They weren’t just people who were friendly to each other because they were forced to live together. Lian listened. Lian respected. Lian made an effort to understand him.

After dinner, Kiyoshi checked his phone for messages from Keima. He was proud of his boyfriend's newfound passion to learn. Unlike their peers, they didn't study for college entrance exams and their vacation period was substantially longer. Kiyoshi was well aware he would burn out if he continued helping Keima every day.

Kiyoshi typed a quick reply about his day, signing off that he would retire early to bed. He had just settled under the covers when he heard Lian grumble.

"Ugh, it's so itchy. Need to get another brand."

Kiyoshi lifted his head, finding Lian with a patch in hand. Kiyoshi asked if his tummy hurt. Lian kindly answered it was another type of medicine.

"Are you okay?"

"Yeah, just an allergy. Guess I'll have to try the T shots." Lian seemed to say the latter more to himself.

Where had he heard those words? The memory eluded him like trying to catch an apparition from the corner of his eye. His forehead was warm and his brain sluggish as if it had been studying for hours on end. The symptoms weren't going away until he had a full night's sleep.

——

Keima stopped in front of him. The corner of his lips quirked upwards, jade green pools warm and cheeky. "Homework at the library now?"

"Mn, I realized Lian was having a hard time focusing on his work, so we're changing study places."

Keima pulled a chair and scooted closer as Kiyoshi rested on the table. Their knees bumped. Kiyoshi complained, but Keima insisted on slipping in. Rearranging themselves, they settled face-to-face, legs a tangled mess.

"Cozy, huh?" Keima asked smoothly.

Kiyoshi couldn't tear his eyes off those thick lips, huffing and puffing from trying the impossible. "Kei, a single-person booth is for one person," Kiyoshi had whined. Even if the standard size was larger, two fully grown people was cutting it close.

College-related stress dropped like dead weight. In its place, arousal broke out on his skin, aching for contact. He reached the limit in a few seconds, breathing, *"Kiss me already."*

Keima snorted and tried to pull away. The back of his head thumped against the wood, tearing a groan that passed as a wheeze. "Kiyoshi, you're so funny!"

"I'm horny~" he whimpered before deadpanning. "Touch me."

Keima's snickers stopped, leaving a lopsided smile. "Tough day, huh?"

"*Too* tough. There was another meeting for the cooking club to-be. We need to attract *more* people and find an *advisor* as well as have a plan. All for the *next* semester. I'm *beaten*. And. . ."

Keima repeated, "and?"

Kiyoshi pursed his lips. ". . . Nevermind."

Keima leaned closer, draping an arm across Kiyoshi's shoulder. "Good work. I can't touch you the way you want but. . . we can make out." Kei's gaze pulled him in like an ant to a piece of food. His hand, hanging onto the table's edge, moved to Kei's cheek. His mind melted into the sensation on his lips and Kei's firm but gentle touch.

When the kiss broke, Keima brushed their noses together. Kiyoshi couldn't see his face, so he accepted the darkness and focused on breathing.

The grip on the back of his shirt shifted, rousing him. Keima whispered, "I wanted to see you."

Kiyoshi caressed his boyfriend's cheek. "Uhn. . . I'm happy to see you."

Keima exhaled through his nose like a compressed coil that unwinded. Kiyoshi asked if there was something wrong. "No, I think these aren't the words I wanted to say. Don't worry. Say, your birthday's coming soon. What do you want to do?" Kiyoshi usually had options, but in years like this, he didn't have an immediate answer. "Do you want to spend it with me? Your family? Maybe we can go somewhere. . ."

The topic dropped for Kiyoshi to ponder over each option. Moving to a bigger table, they focused on schoolwork until bedtime.

——

"Rian, hypothetically, if I were to invite (you) to a birthday party. Would you go?"

"Whose party?" Lian hummed.

Kiyoshi felt his cheeks flush. He pointed at himself. "Me."

Lian beamed, too precious for words. "Oh! Yeah, sure! Is Kei coming too?" He nodded for the sake of the conversation. "We'll be the same age! Will we? Ah, my bad, right, you said you will be eighteen this year. So, when's the party going to be?"

"Um, Wednesday, maybe. Two-three. Tw—enty three."

"Alrighty, lemme know the details!" It was hard to imagine having the same reaction in Lian's shoes. It did sound like a situation someone more extroverted would enjoy. Heck, Kei wouldn't even care about the birthday person if a friend invited him. Nevertheless, Lian's answer made him so happy he was about cry.

——

During the weekends, the cafeteria—with only dorm students and service staff—was thinly crowded. The atmosphere was cozy and welcoming like a hotel on an off-season trip.

From the corner of his eye, Kiyoshi saw Lian waving at a passerby. His roommate pulled a chair, making a grand but friendly gesture as the stranger sat daintily.

Actually, it was no stranger. It was Kei's roommate, the Korean-looking model. Or at least Kiyoshi would believe he was half-Korean. His make-up was meticulously simple, highlighting his best qualities. Kiyoshi couldn't have done his outfit any better. It was the same for Lian, who looked dashing.

Compared to them, Kiyoshi was wearing the muted pieces they bought in a rush.

Seeing the two pretty boys chat amicably, Kiyoshi felt a bone-chilling cold. His vision narrowed to the plates in front of him. The next bites rolled down this constricted throat like pebbles.

Keima cupped Kiyoshi's fist. Kiyoshi peeked from the rim of his glasses, recoiling at Lian and Theo's voices. Scrunching his eyes shut, a tear rolled down.

Keima's eyes shot open. Kiyoshi's shoulders trembled like thin branches, body curling in itself. Keima rushed to his side, pulling Kiyoshi out of the cafeteria and into the toilets.

A quick peek showed they were alone. The silence was deafening. Rugged breaths and Kiyoshi's quiet sobs reverberated on the fancy light-colored walls.

"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Kei." Kiyoshi wiped the tears that streamed down his cheeks. "I ruined our meal." When? Why? How? He was enjoying a nice weekend lunch with a loved one and. . . Lian. It was quiet and comfortable. This shouldn't be happening!

He felt Keima gently wrap him into a hug. "You didn't ruin anything. It's not your fault."

Kiyoshi choked, burrowing into Keima's shoulder. "Why am I like this? I don't want to be. It's been so hard to talk to people. I cry every day. I'm so scared."

Keima rubbed his back with a neutral expression. Then, as if they just registered, his expression twisted. "It's going to be okay."

They stood still until Kiyoshi calmed down. Kiyoshi's curious skin tone was the color of hay drying under the late sunset. Like a broken record, a thought echoed in Keima's head.

*'This appearance isn't Japanese.'*

He froze. Then, his face heated up like a kettle, teeth grinding against each other.

"I'm gonna wash my face," Kiyoshi said slowly, strolling towards the basins. "Kei, about Rian, I don't know how to face him—"

"We should go back." Keima turned away, scurrying to the door.

Inside the dining hall, Lian and Theo, along with their plates, were gone. Another group had taken their place. If Kiyoshi was normal, maybe he could talk and laugh the way they do.
