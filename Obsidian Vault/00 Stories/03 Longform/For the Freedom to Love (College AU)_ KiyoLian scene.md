# For the Freedom to Love (College AU)_ KiyoLian scene

"Hey, Lian?"

"Yup?"

"Have. . . you ever felt like you didn't belong?"

***[Lian's reaction]***

He wanted to trust someone, Lian, about this.

Kiyoshi hugged his pillow, leaning back against the wall. He ordered the events in his life, finding the words to summarize such a complicated concept.

Because of how I look, I have felt I was being treated different. Natural blonde hair isn't common. I look pretty Western. So, I was treated as if I didn't belong. I'm. . . really insecure about it.
