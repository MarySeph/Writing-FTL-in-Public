One of his characteristic expressions is his challenging smile which he reserves for those close to him, Kiyoshi and Itsuki.

## Personality:
^personality

Kei resembles a dog, open, cheerful, and active. His speech and mannerisms are masculine, coming from a sports background. Stereotypically, he acts like a dudebro[^archetype]. He's straightforward and informal, even tactless which can hurt those who lean on the sensitive side. However, around Kiyoshi, Keima is much more careful and considerate. Having known each other for a long time and being romantic partners, Keima's priority is to treat Kiyoshi with care. Thus, he thinks before he acts.

[^archetype]: [[Kei's Character Arc_ Masculine Identity#^archetype]]

Keima is a heart before head person. His emotions dictate his actions and are the main reason he doesn't think things through. He's also independent and hates being ordered around and caged in. He wants the freedom to do what he wants to do and not follow a predetermined path.

He is also fiercely loyal and immensely supportive. While he can support people he isn't loyal to, he's much more passionate about helping those he cares about. When giving advice, he internalizes the issue and uses personal examples, basing his response on beliefs and opinions, not any ideal. In other words, he's highly biased and not one to slip out probabilities or what-ifs. He believes that emotions and feelings are above everything else. While he's enthusiastic about the prospect of being of help, he makes an effort to not force others to accept it. 

Despite his tendency to chase emotional experiences, Kei has a hard time being emotionally vulnerable around others. ^[[[Kei's Character Arc_ Masculine Identity]]] ^[[[On Keima and Adhering to Gender Roles]]] He's fulfilled through helping others but feels uncomfortable asking for help.^[[[Kei's Character Arc_ Masculine Identity]]] ^[[[On Keima and Adhering to Gender Roles]]] This is also due to his independent nature, however, he doesn't like considering his problems need outside aid.^[[[Kei's Character Arc_ Masculine Identity]]] ^[[[On Keima and Adhering to Gender Roles]]] He also has the habit to diminish his problems by belittling himself. This is Keima's biggest obstacle towards self-actualization, something he has been struggling with throughout his life.

Kei has thick skin, meaning he doesn't feel embarrassed easily. On the other hand, he can be described as shameless. While he can't read delicate social cues, he's sensitive to other people's emotions, especially about him. He finds most social manners stuffy and overcomplicated, preferring to be honest and direct. In addition, he's naive in matters of attraction and romantic feelings. However, if he thinks a guy is flirting with him, he feels shy.

After moving overseas, he had a hard time communicating with others because of the language barrier. This obstacle and the culture shock led him to resent the culture around him. Thus, he can be biased against Westerners, and xenophobic to other cultures.

Keima loves his partner a lot. Around most people but a select few, Kei holds back from gushing about how wonderful Kiyoshi is.^[[[Kei's Character Arc_ Masculine Identity]]] ^[[[On Keima and Adhering to Gender Roles]]] Additionally, when he sees Kiyoshi while he's with others, he has a strong urge to get his attention. They have been dating for so many years but as Kei becomes more honest with himself, his attraction to his partner strengthens. He described Kiyoshi as light he can't help but feel pulled towards. This desire to be with the one he loves clashes with the desire to be free and live without strings attached. He wants to be with Kiyoshi forever but he used to believe he would travel by himself and never be tied down to anyone.

He has trouble thinking long-term and the immediate future. Kei prefers enjoying the present and not worried about what will happen. This leaves him unprepared for foreseeable situations.

## Skills: 
Social skills, people skills, teamwork, freerunning, vaulting, critical thinking.

## Hobbies:
- Exercise; is his primary hobby. He's a regular at the gym. Whenever he eats a lot of sweets, he tells himself he must hit the gym the next day. He keeps a strict routine and reps at home when idle.
- Video games; mostly yuri visual novels but includes those with hunk protagonists. His favorite yuri is the Flowers series. He hogs the internet to play on the living room TV.
- Going out with friends.

## Likes: 
- Dogs; Kei was raised with a golden retriever, Hachi-dan. He's fond of big fluffy breeds like Retrievers, Huskies, and Malamutes.
- Sports; He plays a lot of contact sports such as soccer and basketball.
- Food; it's fucking delicious, the best when his partner makes it. He eventually learns how to cook.
- Bara manga; Kei found it as he learned about BL. He relates to the non-bishounen guys, usually with more body fat and body hair. While bara is highly sexually explicit, he enjoys the emotional aspect and sympathizes with the characters' queer angst. The absurd stories entertain him. His favorite series is Priapus. Boy's Love/Yaoi with its heterosexual dynamics and slim, pretty boys aren't his cup of tea. ^bara

## Dislikes:
- Negative people; primarily judgemental ones. He feels uncomfortable around them and is bound to get into arguments.
- Cats; One hurt his dog when they were little. He finds them unnerving, unpredictable, and too small.
- Studying; Keima dislikes learning that involves sitting around. This includes homework and studying.
- Being alone; As an extrovert, Kei doesn't like looking inwards. He seeks company and excitement to avoid loneliness and letting his thoughts consume him. If Kiyoshi isn't at home, Kei usually leaves too.

## Gender & Sexuality:
Kei is attached to the label of asexual/ace. He has been since he learned about it during middle school and takes pride in being ace. This usually leads to limiting his actions regarding attraction, and an obstacle in his personal development in his relationship with his partner^[[[Kei's Character Arc_ Masculine Identity]]] ^[[[On Keima and Adhering to Gender Roles]]]. Because of his lack of self-esteem, his attachments become his insecurities. Thus, every time his actions don't align with his self-perception, he becomes anxious^[[[Kei's Character Arc_ Masculine Identity]]] ^[[[On Keima and Adhering to Gender Roles]]]. As years passed and he learns to love himself, his insecurities lessen.
Keima has been working on his internalized homophobia since he acknowledged his romantic relationship was with another guy, in his second year of middle school^[[[Kei's Character Arc_ Masculine Identity]]] ^[[[On Keima and Adhering to Gender Roles]]]. He had a hard time accepting and engaging in romantic intimacy, cuddling, kissing, and hugging.^[[[Kei's Character Arc_ Masculine Identity]]] ^[[[On Keima and Adhering to Gender Roles]]] However, if the context was platonic--because they have been best friends for many years--he was all right with it. Before Kiyoshi, Keima never envisioned himself having a romantic partner; he's adamant about remaining single if his relationship ends. He's uninterested in looking for another romantic/sexual partner apart from Kiyoshi. He doesn't want exclusively sexual relationships either.

Kei's idea of a guy is based on a few concepts: Intimately passive but sexually proactive, useful (e. g. pleasure their partner whenever they want), be heterosexual. Hence, since he started dating Kiyoshi (AMAB), his view on sexuality has been challenged.^[[[Kei's Character Arc_ Masculine Identity]]] ^[[[On Keima and Adhering to Gender Roles]]] First, he accepted he was in love with another guy, then to practice romantic physical intimacy (kiss, etc), and lastly that his worth as a man isn't tied to his sexual utility.^[[[Kei's Character Arc_ Masculine Identity]]] ^[[[On Keima and Adhering to Gender Roles]]] This development spans many years and it's still ongoing.^[[[Kei's Character Arc_ Masculine Identity]]] ^[[[On Keima and Adhering to Gender Roles]]] In his college years, the focus has been on sexual intimacy. ^[[[Kei's Character Arc_ Masculine Identity]]] ^[[[On Keima and Adhering to Gender Roles]]] Keima has learned he has many kinks which are independent of his sexual orientation, and that it's okay to receive pleasure instead of giving it.^[[[Kei's Character Arc_ Masculine Identity]]] ^[[[On Keima and Adhering to Gender Roles]]]

Content-wise, he prefers consuming stories with buff people where he can relate. This is the reason he enjoys bara/men's love, despite it being homosexual content. [^bara] 

[^bara]: [[#^bara]]

Keima can be tactless and insensitive about other gender and sexualities, voicing his assumptions and bias that can make him seem sexist, misogynistic, and of course, homophobic. He's particularly biased about female identities.
With help of his partner, he's been receiving therapy. It has helped him learn about his hang-ups on these topics and re-evaluate his beliefs. It is a constant effort and change.
Lastly, after he develops a crush for Lian, he realizes his romantic attraction isn't tied to gender. Nevertheless, Kei doesn't feel the need to specify his romantic attraction than demiromantic.


## Current Romantic Relationship: 
^keikiyo

Keima is in a romantic/sexual relationship with Ryuugamine Kiyoshi, his best friend. They have been dating since their 2nd year in middle school and their relationship has been rocky. Keima agreed to follow Kiyoshi to an overseas college, leaving Japan. They oppose each other in many ways which makes them clash often. They do because of their long friendship and trust; they feel safe sharing their emotions, even the small ones. Thus, there are a lot of moments with heightened emotions that eventually get resolved. They know each other deeply and learned to establish boundaries and limits to what they shouldn't say, finding common ground to discuss constructively. Kiyoshi believes in emotional honesty and that comes naturally to Keima who is blunt with words. As young adults, their arguments are mostly related to establishing new routines, coping mechanisms, and the occasional bad day. They argue because they are different, they learn about those new differences, and they make up by accepting and compromising on those differences. 

Throughout their time together, Kiyoshi and Keima have learned how to help each other, their best qualities as well as the nasty ones. They have grown from strangers, brothers, to friends, and lovers. However, no matter how much they change together, they are keenly aware of some things don't know about each other.

In the relationship, Kiyoshi is the stability while Keima is the spontaneity. Kiyoshi is calm while Keima is in the storm. Kiyoshi brings Keima to the ground and thinks long-term and Keima helps Kiyoshi enjoy the present without worrying about the future and what-ifs.

At Keima's request, they have a home theatre in their apartment. Keima is an avid fan of motion pictures and video games. Kiyoshi enjoys observing, although he used to play with Keima when they were younger.

Because Kiyoshi enjoys cooking and experimenting with dishes, their kitchen is spacious and well-packed with cooking utensils. Kiyoshi loves to cook and Keima loves to eat his cooking. Both are fond of baked treats.

When Keima learns how to cook, cooking duty is split.

Alcohol-wise, Keima is lightweight while Kiyoshi can handle it well.

Keima's main concern is his partner's health. Kiyoshi has a high metabolism and does little exercise; he's underweight and doesn't eat enough for his height. Keima insists for him to accompany him to the gym but Kiyoshi stayed lazy and unmotivated about it.

Kei can be overprotective about Kiyoshi. [[Why is Kei an Angsty Pup in his adulthood#^self-blame]] Their long relationship included Kei reading Kiyo's body language and coming to his aid. It was a mutual agreement. As Kiyoshi manages his social anxiety, mental health, becomes more comfortable in social settings, and communicates with Kei, he speaks less in Kiyoshi's stead and lets him hold on to his own. Kei supports his partner throughout the lows, checking up on him and helping however he can. When Kei acknowledges his actions weren't okay, he swiftly apologizes.


## Platonic Relationships:
Kei is close so some people in the soccer club.

Other relationships include Kiyoshi's roommate, a transguy named Lian Yu, nicknamed 'Rian' because of his accent, and his mostly unhealthy exchanges with his former roommate, Theo Fanai. He's not particularly close to them but he has confided in Lian a few times and eventually develops a crush for him. He sees Theo when he and Lian are invited to hang out with Kiyoshi and him, never because he wants Theo around. Their exchange is exclusively neutral or negative.
Kei, consciously or not, keeps his platonic relationships are at surface level. He would rather have a good time than delve into serious topics. Thus, he has many people to talk and hang out with but few he would ask for help or advice. This is another reason his relationship with Kiyoshi is unique, the mutual trust. However, he does open up to Lian Yu after he has gone through the painful moments.

## Social Media:
- Keima has a Twitter account where he tweets things he considers dumb and retweets dog videos. For the most part, he uses it to reply to his partner's posts with internal jokes but also interacts with other friends. His bio says he's @[Kiyoshi's username] trash bin for he eats everything Kiyoshi cooks so it doesn't go to waste.
- When texting others, Kei uses little emotes and emotes, usually sounding deadpan. With his partner, he uses a lot of dog gifs of his favorite breeds.
- He appeared in a couple of episodes of Kiyoshi's BL podcast as the opinion towards bara manga and diverse bodies in MLM Japanese manga.
- He uses LINE to keep in touch with his Asian friends.

## Occupation:
Keima chose to study Sports Management to learn how to help people become or retain fitness. He's passionate and slightly knowledgeable on the topic, having done sports for most of his life.
