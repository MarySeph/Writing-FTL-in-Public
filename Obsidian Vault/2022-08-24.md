## What did I do?
I got to the [[My First Digital Garden, a Web Development Project]]. The following is a summary of what I did:
- created and wrote relevant pages about hsp and learning in public.
- added embeds of videos, tweets, and web pages (media)[[My First Digital Garden, a Web Development Project#^676921]]
- linked relevant content to the landing page
- tested the mind garden with th graph view
- the graph view was very helpful to see the pathways I made available to users
- deleted section on the sex lives of kei and kiyo and links to underdeveloped fleeting notes
- brushed up the index page
- added a chapter section in the landing page and bi-directional links to the two completed chapters. Maybe do leave the third?
- Maybe add [[2022-08-24]], [[My First Digital Garden, a Web Development Project]], and [[Self-hosting my Digital Garden with Github, and perhaps Tiddlywiki]] to the mind garden? Linked through the learning in public section?

Outside the vault, I made a tweet about the project and shared it on the Obsidian Discord Group.
