# I would like to self-host my digital garden with Github and perhaps Tiddlywiki

---

The end goal of the notes here in this vault is to be sent out there to the interwebs. For that, I would like to have a digital garden where I can grow and display my ideas and thoughts (a little more polished than your main vault). Obsidian Publish was an option but it is a paid service and I don't have the money to use it right now.

Here's a couple of handy guides on how you can get around doing this: https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up and https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-tiddlywiki

I followed the steps, downloading a static website created through [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/#GettingStarted) and uploaded it to Github Pages. I had to delete the index.html that was already there and replaced it with the `empty.html` renamed `index.html`. It's not a perfect website, but it was only a test. My curiosity could only be held down for so long, haha. Here's the link: https://maryseph.github.io/. The toolbar is supposed to be hidden, so as I said, it's not the strongest base. Gotta troubleshoot this one day. For now, I deleted the files so the link leads nowhere. My focus as of 2022-08-25 is at [[My First Digital Garden, a Web Development Project]].

There's more links that can help you in this new project (really? Another one? Oh well).

# Tom's Description on how he built the wiki for his Digital Garden
https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/

He uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

This is his repo on Github: https://github.com/tomcritchlow/tomcritchlow.github.io. https://tomcritchlow.github.io sends you directly to https://tomcritchlow.com/. #question Does he use a custom domain? Yes he does. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is a place where you can buy domains and apply them to GitHub pages. Some redirection happens.

In [this post](https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/05/19/tiddlywiki-krystal/), Tom mentions [Krystal Theme](https://crazko.github.io/krystal/) for [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/#GettingStarted) by [Roman Veselý](https://romanvesely.com/). These are the features:
-   horizontal story view for tiddlers
-    Bi-directional links at the bottom of each tiddler
-   Customizable header instead of sidebar
-   edit/view Toolbar option to maximize tiddler width
-   nice animations and transitions

https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden has this interesting image: ![here|275](https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mind-garden-hierarchy.png)

Perhaps your main Obsidian Vault *shouldn't be published as is.* Perhaps a mind garden is it's own place. Actually, duh, a garden isn't a bedroom. Your bedroom is where your personal items reside, things that resonate with you. Like [Ali writes in his book notes of "Share Your Work"](https://aliabdaal.com/book-notes/show-your-work/ "https://aliabdaal.com/book-notes/show-your-work/"), "Sharing vs Oversharing." Your bedroom is private while your garden is public! So make another folder called "Mary's Mind Garden." Cute!

This mind garden can be hosted on Github with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Github allows one site per user, with your account name as the name of the repo. Project sites, or one-page sites I believe. Here's another page about this: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart

You already know how to publish pages with GithubPages, but there are the reminders. Perhaps you can also get more familiar with forking and branches because what scared you from jumping into hosting this mind garden in Wordpress is that you won't have a copy of its current set-up and that's scary and painful. Scary and painful? It's much more comfortable to have a space dedicated to playing round with stuff, and the current blog looks fantastic. Tearing it apart is such a waste. The demos have worked great so far. Having a sanbox to test new stuff is *honestly*, the smart thing to do, haha.

This [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) thing keeps being mentioned. It's a software to create static websites. [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/#GettingStarted) is an open source software for knowledge management. It's a single file(empty.html) that has HTML, CSS, and JS. It's a toolbox and a tool at the same time. With an export button, you can create static websites. Whereas [[TiddlyBlink]] adds bi-directional linking and other sweet functions to [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/#GettingStarted).

Where can you start right now? Make a new vault named `Mary's Mind Garden.` Treat it like what [[LYT Kit 6]] does, as if it's its own website. It's YOUR LYT Kit 6. WOW!

Another Obsidian and digital gardener uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [Logseq](https://logseq.com/): https://garden.rahulrajeev.net/how-this-site-works

## Tasks

- [ ] Download Notion Mind Garden in Markdown format and start making tiddlers out of them. Get it to the web ASAP! You can organize it later. But also encrypt the data beforehand: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v95EYwGpQiM&list=PLzZCajspPU_UjFn0uy-J9URz0LP4zhxRK&index=7
