I love learning. After reading [this article](https://salman.io/blog/polymath-playbook/) from Salam, I realized I may indeed be a polymath.

Unrelated to any skillset in Mathematics, sadly.

I have many interests. Environmental Sciences, Mathematics, Philosophy, Music, Knowledge Management, Note-taking, Web Development, Creative Writing, and perhaps everything considered 'nerdy.' I'm a big nerd.

Because I love learning, I know the most effective way to learn is to teach. I also suffer from anxiety, and I think I'm a private person, so I don't tell others weird thing I'm working on at any given time. I'm also a [highly sensitive person| [[What's this Highly Sensitive People thing?]]] and I love deeply engaging conversations. For some reason or another, connecting with people has been a struggle.

Ironically, I don't think I'm alone in this.

I don't remember how I started getting interested in this knowledge management thing. Perhaps because I realized I feel like I'm slowly dying intellectually if I don't **write**. I love writing. It's wonderful *cries*. Surfing through the internet led me to Tiago Forte's Building Your Second Brain and from there to Niklas Leuhmann's Zettelkasten method. I opened a Notion account and before I knew it, I was in deep whatever this is called.

On July 2022, I decided to change my cellphone. Evernote was one of the first note-taking software I consistenly used. I wrote a whole novel and multiple single-chapter stories under  another pen name. As some of you know, Evernote has just recently started implening a little piece of thing called bi-directional linking. Notion served better for personal project management, so both softwares have brought me a lot of joy.

Doing this hardware made my life, if I may be so dramatic, went to shit. The last Evernote update I used was back in about 2020. *I didn't know that with the new CEO and the changes implemented, the UI and it's functionalitys drasically changed.* I'm talking about mobile. I used the web version, yes; I didn't think the experience on mobile was going to be *that* bad. 

It's so bad. 

I need an internet connection to use Evernote.

That's not an option. I was in love with the offline feature. I could write without distractions and save battery with that Android 6.0 device.

For the first-time in my life, I experienced data-lock. As I mentioned at the beginning, I live for writing. In Evernote, I had all my draft for my blog and stories, as well as years of archived content. When I check, I had 1.5k notes. All behind a data-lock. I don't know how to describe the horror. It was similar to having a Twitter account for media analysis but for a tool I had consistently used for about seven years.

I had to get it out. It was one of the hardest I had done in my life. There was too much at stake to not hyperfixate on it.

Around two months after this event, I'm writing this in Obsidian. The migration is partially complete. I have much to do in terms of managing my knowledge in a new tool. It's like moving to a new neighborhood, perhaps and entirely new country. I have taken more seriously open-sourced projects and learned to code with HTML and CSS on Skillshare (for a different purpose than to cultivate my own space in the internet, the desire to learn).

Learning in public with a digital garden, for me, is just another way to share the content I make. I have never post incomplete stuff on the internet unless I'm positive I'm never gonna touch it again, but I enjoy clicking around other's digital gardens, and making my own space, owned by me, empowers me. It brings me back to the beginning of the 2000 were the internet was like going on an adventure, like opening Microsoft Encarta Kids and learning something new, anything. I believe tools like that helped me on my early development and digital literacy. When my classmates began to use the internet centered around social media, I couldn't keep up. It was shallow, immature, and judgement, not the adventure I had experienced as a young person.

I believe digital gardens bring back those times of wonders and discovery. It makes the internet seem less scary when it's more than a place where the people who yell the loudest are the ones that dictate the truth and many more negative things as a culture. The horticulture analogy is also attractive :3. Seeing something grow and develop is a wonderful experiences, like a plant, or a child. Or your own ideas.

I want a digital garden to reclain ownership of my space as a an internet user. I want a digital garden to grow my ideas. I want my digital garden to be accessible to others. I want my digital garden to be an adventure for everyone. I want my digital garden to be as peaceful and calming as a green space.

I'm aware digital garden are, as of this time, a sole endeavor. As someone who craves connection but is also timid, this project may change me. While as a fiction writer I rarely get meaningful comments and making someone on some part of the world too vague for me to feel something, it's the act of putting incomplete, and perhaps complete *wrong and or inaccurate* that makes my fingers over the keyboard halt. **I'm terrified of looking like a fool and be mocked for it!** Yet, there is also the part of me that wants to be discovered.

Seeing other people's inner weird little world is always fascinating. I think, if I feel that way about them, perhaps someone will find my weird little world fascinating too.
