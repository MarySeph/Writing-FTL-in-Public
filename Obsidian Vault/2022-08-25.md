I did the dummy thing and just uploaded the md files up to the public repo and hosted it on Github Pages. It shows! The index.md is displayed!

Naturally, the bi-directional links don't work, and the deployment through Netlify isn't working either. It's not because, I think, because there aren't any HTML files. They're all Markdown files.

I really wanted to know what to know what would happen, haha.

Anywways, I have the Netlify site all set-up (Netlify account linked to my GitHub account, including the repo). I think all that's left is to import the MD files to TiddlyWiki and fix the bi-directional links.

Maybe even try the TiddlyMap plugin that's already installed.

Update: The site is up on [GithubPages](https://maryseph.github.io/Writing-FTL-in-Public/). Netlify's dashboard is loaded with terms I don't understand (yet?). I think I will use Github Pages instead. I want to focus on improving the site's navigation.

What I did to get to this point is:
- Imported relevant markdown files to TiddlyWiki(drag-and-drop).
	- I reccomend editing out the `.md` extension before completining the import.
	- Started with two files, testing TiddlyWiki and learning how to use it before importing more files. Slow and steady wins the race.
	- It seems that when `'` is used in titles, TiddlyWiki doesn't read them? I found some issues where I mentioned a tiddly(note or card) with an apostrophe but the bi-directional link didn't work. 
- I set-up automatic saving with the GitHub repo
	- created new repo called `Writing FTL in Public`
	- created new personal access token from Settings>Developed Settings>Personal Access Token
		- Named the token `Chromebook Access token TiddlyWiki`
	- copied the token and pasted it in Configuration>Saving>Github Saver
		- TiddlyWiki also needs the following information:
			- Username (YOURGITHUBACCOUNTNAME)
			- Name of the repository (USERNAME/REPONAME)
			- Branch name (I created a new branch called `tiddlywiki`)
			- File name (I used `index.html`)
	- I used the manual to check if a message appears in the top right (pale-yellow box saying `Saved Wiki`) and double-checked the repo by looking at the commit history right after (must say last commit was seconds ago)
	- The reason I set up this was because I couldn't leave the full-screen and I couldn't find how to, so I had to close the tab, losing my chages. Very frustrating... learning I learned TiddlyWiki's **number one rule**. SET UP AUTO SAVING!
- I fixed the bi-directional links that didn't work.
	- those that have alias didn't work. It's just how TiddlyWiki markdown works.
- Erased some metadata
- Added most of the tiddlys to the content bar or nestled them inside another, mimicking folders.
	- The structure in Obsidian has two folders, so I wanted to display it the same in TiddlyWiki.
		- Funnily, **the content bar doesn't show in the static site** so I guess it was more for the developer's sake than the reader, haha.
		- Because of that, I added the tiddlys on the "folder" they link to, serving as an index of sorts.
- Added <br> to new yaml section because single breaks aren't read.
- Renamed some files with vestiges of [[Obsidian Demo-v2.5]] naming conventions such as chapter titles.
- Did a quick spellcheck.

# What to do tomorrow? [[2022-08-26]]
- [x] Get feedback on the site's navigation from a third party.
- [x] Improve the navigation by using it yourself
	- [x] Reference section
	- [x] `up:: [[link]]`  line you wrote yourself.
	- [x] Make the images display instead of showing the link to the tiddler.
	- [x] Fix the citations. No ideas for that at the moment. Perhaps they will be erased.
		- How can a tiddler be displayed like it does in Obsidan with `![[link]]`? Is it possible to do this?
			- **Answer**: It's possible, and it's called [[transclusion]]. Use `{{tiddlername}}` to transclude/display a tiddler. 
				- There's also a plugin called RefNotes for TiddlyWiki
				- I ended up removing the Obsidian-style references as they didn't work and lack of time to implement the plugin.
- [x] When there's an external link inside a link, there's no space between it an the next word. Odd.
	- Formatting was incorrect. Different from Obsidian. Fixed. 
- [x] The admonition block I wrote in Obsidian for content warnings don't display the same. 
		- I don't know if I'll have the time to find how to make a callout block in TiddlyWiki, but the warning will nevertheless be displayed at the start of the tiddler, perhaps not in a color that pops.
		- Answer: I couldn't find anything similar to admonishons due to time contraints. I used some HTML to change the color of the text and make it bold. I'm sure there's something out there. The theme quarto has admonition style blocks. Maybe there's a plugin for TiddlyWiki.
- [x] Clean up the rest of the YAML
