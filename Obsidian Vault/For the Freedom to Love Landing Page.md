For the Freedom to Love is a story in the process of being written by MarySeph(they/them). It's inteded to have a cast of LBGT+/queer characters, exploring [sexuality in it's many forms| [[FTL Brainstorm 2#^sexuality]]].

![[00.04 Summary]]


---

The writer has many points of critisim towards the, being specific for the sake of understanding, the Tumblr, and perhaps pop culture's education of sexuality (i.e attraction in it's many forms, arousal, sexual orientation, and sexual identity). For them, the definitions are too rigid. The education isn't based on deep understanding. For the writer, learning about the works of Foucault and Simone DeBeavoir have been much more education than the shallow informal education of the internet. The writer is deeply passionate about philosophy, and usually whatever bothers them about the real world becomes minuscule and "one way to seeing things" instead of an absolute. Philosophy reassures the writer they aren't the only one who doesn't accept what many echo.

The most important file so far is the [brainstorm| [[FTL Brainstorm 2]]]. The writer is exposing themselves, their deepest interests. One of their favorite parts is the "dish they can cook" with the "ingredients" they are most passionate about: ![[FTL Brainstorm 2#^52be92]]

The main character will hopefully be [[Kirishima Keima]] and [[Ryuugamine Kiyoshi]]. These characters have existed for a little more than half a decade. They had another moment to shine in the author's first novel under another penname(I'm sure it's shit, but it served as a fertizer for this story).

The main characters have graduated from highschool and moved to another country (some place that isn't Asia) to go to college. Any finer points are merely ideas such as [Keima meeting an upperclass from highschool that ended up being gay| [[Keima bumps into a senpai from HS. They catch up and he tells Keima he was gay all along as his boyfriend (a white dude) pops in for a sec K]]] and [Kiyoshi's birthday being a relevant plot point| [[Kiyoshi's birthday is coming up.]]]. The main side character, Kiyoshi's roommate, [[Lian Yu]] is of unknown relevance, but I would really like to include him. He's an original character from a good friend and our roleplays have dictated Kiyoshi and Lian are good friends.

One of Kiyoshi's struggles is that he's half Asian, Japanese mom, and half-Western (American dad). The tables have turned for him, he's not a minority anymore. I don;t know if this will be relevant to the actual story, but I wanted it to be know.

Writing about fun details I want to share, I'm deeply interested in masculinity. This is where [[Kirishima Keima]] is crucial. He is the conversation. Keima and Kiyoshi are heavily based on Boy's Love, a genre focused on same-sex relationships, primarily romance between men. It can make for some interesting discussion of gender roles in homosexual relationships and a discussion on masculinity. [[Lian Yu]] can also be a vehicle for this topic as he's an ftm transguy. Lots of interesting things to say about manhood and masculinity! Perhaps that's one of the reasons the cast is for the most part self-identifying as male. *I don't know how to write women either.* Writer limitations, haha.

Because I'm the god of this story, I can make the [setting| [[10.01 College]]] as queer friendly as I want. I wonder if I will be able to slip into the story is seemly dichotomy of Christianity and queerness? [[Ryuugamine Kiyoshi|Kiyoshi]] is the focus here, as his dad is Christian but Kiyoshi was raised by his non-religious mother and he's a queer person.

Talking about queerness, I have also explored the topic of labels. The character at the center would be [[Kirishima Keima|Keima]] who identifies as asexual. With him, I explore the downside of restricting behavior based on a self-conception of how someone from a certain sexual orientation ought to act. What they are and not allowed to do.
