Last day of the [[My First Digital Garden, a Web Development Project]].

I completed the checklist from the [[previous day|2022-08-25]].

# Troubleshooting
- Exported the site as a static website and uploaded it to the Github branch `gh-pages` for last checks.
	- When I checked it at Github Pages, I noticed I missed fixing a couple of links (`'` this doesn't work in tiddler title names so I had to remove them), and most importantly, the main page needs to be renamed so it loads first.
		- Maybe I can rename it `index.html` after exporting it but ***before*** uploading it to Github.
- Last thing to do is to upload this file to TiddlyWiki, export the site, delete unneccesary files (particularly the export one; maybe I'll keep it one day), and rename `Start Here.html` to `index.thml`, and upload the files to the `gh-pages` branch.

~**THE END**~
