It’s intended to have a cast of LBGT+/queer characters, exploring <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="FTL%2520Brainstorm%25202%2523%255Esexuality.html">sexuality in it’s many forms</a>.</span></p>
<p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="00.04%2520Summary.html">00.04 Summary</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The writer has many points of criticism towards the, being specific for the sake of understanding, the Tumblr, and perhaps pop culture’s education of sexuality (i.e attraction in it’s many forms, arousal, sexual orientation, and sexual identity). For them, the definitions are too rigid. The education isn’t based on deep understanding. For the writer, learning about the works of Foucault and Simone De Beauvoir have been much more education than the shallow informal education of the internet. The writer is deeply passionate about philosophy, and usually whatever bothers them about the real world becomes minuscule and “one way to seeing things” instead of an absolute. Philosophy reassures the writer they aren’t the only one who doesn’t accept what many echo.</p>
<p><span>The most important file so far is the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="FTL%2520Brainstorm%25202.html">brainstorm</a>. The writer is exposing themselves, their deepest interests. One of their favorite parts is the “dish they can cook” with the “ingredients” they are most passionate about: !<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="FTL%2520Brainstorm%25202%2523%255E52be92.html">FTL Brainstorm 2#^52be92</a></span></p>
<p><span>The main character will hopefully be <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Kirishima%2520Keima.html">Kirishima Keima</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Ryuugamine%2520Kiyoshi.html">Ryuugamine Kiyoshi</a>. These characters have existed for a little more than half a decade. They had another moment to shine in the author’s first novel under another pen name(I’m sure it’s shit, but it served as a fertilizer for this story).</span></p>
<p><span>The main characters have graduated from high school and moved to another country (some place that isn’t Asia) to go to college. Any finer points are merely ideas such as <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Keima%2520bumps%2520into%2520a%2520senpai%2520from%2520HS.html">Keima meeting an upper class from highschool that ended up being gay</a>. They catch up and he tells Keima he was gay all along as his boyfriend (a white dude) pops in for a sec K]] and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Kiyoshi%25E2%2580%2599s%2520birthday%2520is%2520coming%2520up.html">Kiyoshi’s birthday being a relevant plot point</a>. The main side character, Kiyoshi’s roommate, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Lian%2520Yu.html">Lian Yu</a> is of unknown relevance, but I would really like to include him. He’s an original character from a good friend and our role plays have dictated Kiyoshi and Lian are good friends.</span></p>
<p>One of Kiyoshi’s struggles is that he’s half Asian, Japanese mom, and half-Western (American dad). The tables have turned for him, he’s not a minority anymore. I don;t know if this will be relevant to the actual story, but I wanted it to be know.</p>
<p><span>Writing about fun details I want to share, I’m deeply interested in masculinity. This is where <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Kirishima%2520Keima.html">Keima</a> is crucial. He is the conversation. Keima and Kiyoshi are heavily based on Boy’s Love, a genre focused on same-sex relationships, primarily romance between men. It can make for some interesting discussion of gender roles in homosexual relationships and a discussion on masculinity. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Lian%2520Yu.html">Lian Yu</a> can also be a vehicle for this topic as he’s an ftm transguy. Lots of interesting things to say about manhood and masculinity! Perhaps that’s one of the reasons the cast is for the most part self-identifying as male. </span><em>I don’t know how to write women either.</em>Writer limitations, haha.</p>
<p><span>Because I’m the god of this story, I can make the [setting|College]] as queer friendly as I want. I wonder if I will be able to slip into the story is seemly dichotomy of Christianity and queerness? <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Ryuugamine%2520Kiyoshi.html">Kiyoshi</a> is the focus here, as his dad is Christian but Kiyoshi was raised by his non-religious mother and he’s a queer person.</span></p>
<p><span>Talking about queerness, I have also explored the topic of labels. The character at the center would be <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Kirishima%2520Keima.html">Keima</a> who identifies as asexual. With him, I explore the downside of restricting behavior based on a self-conception of how someone from a certain sexual orientation ought to act. What they are and not allowed to do.</span></p>
