<p><code>Source: Wavemaker</code><br>Kiyoshi has gone a long way from the insecure, asocial boy in  his early teenage years.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Therapy (CBT) has helped him A TON. It started in his 1st yr of HS. He talked about every trouble in his past: parent’s divorce, the sexual abuse, the suicidal thoughts, his mother’s detached attitude, his guilt of forgetting his dada and telling him about Houjou’s 1st &amp; 2nd attempts. Through his father’s, Keima’s, and Shino’s support, he worked through each of them, regaining confidence and finding self-esteem.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>He was scouted as a model (1st yr HS). Kiyoshi’s growing confidence and emboldened him to try smth new. He gets in a shady gig to secure Kei and his financial future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kiyoshi became more outgoing and cheerful, reaching out to Keima and putting effort in his work and studies. Working as a model helped him get out of his shell and comfort zone, although he still had trouble making friends his age.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adopting Mina and Tarou helped him take care of himself by having a responsibility and company when he was alone at home; not anymore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The medication for depression and anxiety helped him too (under strict supervision of Shino).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While Kiyoshi’s thoughts and stories became positive,t he trauma reduced to a whisper. His social anxiety went undiagnosed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He also learned great tools to manage his mental health: journaling (Kyoshi loves to write), deep breathing, mindfulness, guided meditation, guided image, grounding exercises. He does use them all. This is only a comprehensive list. Results and usefulness varied.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kiyoshi likes journaling, deep breathing and grounding best.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>He gets easily overwhelmed in crowded places, triggering his anxiety. He absentmindedly mumbles about it like active danger, or a n ever present one.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>KIyoshi dislikes his height. It was a big disappointment in his relationship leading to a body image issue in his senior Hs and a mild case of anorexia. He wants to feels safe and protected, enjoy the feminine things he likes. Tall isn’t <em>cute,</em>but Lian may help him to see otherwise.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is part of a larger agreement of “being the masc. and the fem” Keima said in the spur of the moment. Bc of this, Kiyoshi rejects being associated w/masculinity and masc. things, whether it be assertiveness, stoicism, physical prowess, sexual dominance, masc. identity, aggression. This includes his insistence on bottoming during sex.</li>
<li>While his mannerisms are polite and feminine, Kiyoshi is insecure of his gender and its expression. He feels uncomfortable being treated as a guy but doesn’t want to be a girl either.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kiyoshi has a hard time making guy friends. Ever if he doesn’t blame himself for what happened, the aftermath, his promiscuity and high libido, is his responsibility. He has either kept physical distance from them or had sexual contact.</p>
</li>
</ul>
