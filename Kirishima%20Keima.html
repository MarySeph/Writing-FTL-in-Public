<p><code>Source: Wavemaker</code><br>A relatively flat character until their 2nd Valentine’s Day.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In intimacy, he focuses on Kiyoshi’s pleasure &amp; happiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keima isn’t in touch with his emotions, covering them up until they overflow. His emotions show before Keima even thinks about considering them.Very ignorant about his emotions. Ironically he’s emotional and sensory driven.</p>
<ul>
<li>In his ignorance, he fails to see what others (specially Kiyoshi) see as a problem.</li>
<li>In moments of distress, he evades to think and feel. For example, after Hachi passed away, Keima avoided acknowledging everything that made him uncomfortable. He looks away, waiting for those strange sensations to disappear.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>He’s homophobic. He finds homosexiality gross &amp; is uncomfortable when other people imply he’s gay. Keima is convinced his relationship with Kiyoshi isn’t homosexual because they adhere to heterosexual dynamics; he’s the guy and Kiyoshi is the girl. He wouldn’t take kindly knowing a guy is gay; he would feel uncomfortable and overconscious, and grossed out. He didn’t have any of these feelings towards Kiyoshi when they were younger bc Kiyoshi isn’t a guy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keima doesn’t see Kiyoshi as a guy. He’s closer to a girls and doesn’t fit Keima’s idea of “a guy.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He puts distance/a barrier between the female gender and himself. Thus, he doesn’t have much experience w/transgenderism or a not clear cut masculinity and femininity. This barrier causes Keima to make assumptions and uninterested in learning about gender. He’s fine in his current place and doesn’t see the need to learn. He zones out of the lectures in the LBGT club; he can’t understand much anyways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keima puts asexuality in a pedestal. He looks down on sexual attraction and people who feel it w/o malice.</p>
<ul>
<li>He isn’t sexually attracted to his lover, following Kiyoshi’s wants and touching him out of true love. The same is on his sexual life; he can truly consent bc he’s not attracted. He has sex bc he wants to (&amp; it feels a lil good). It’s hard to explain @ times.</li>
<li>He’s sex-repulsed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>He believes Kiyoshi is a troubled person who needs aid and support. He believes he doesn’t need any himself, that Kiyoshi needs it more, compared to him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keima is aware of Kiyoshi’s hardships and was at his side for most. He puts Kiyoshi’s well-being first and never considers his own, refusing to accept outside care.</p>
<ul>
<li>He has a vague impression that therapy is for people w/feelings, or have internal trouble; no him.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has decided he won’t date anyone after Kiyoshi. He’s Keima’s first and last love.</p>
</li>
</ul>
