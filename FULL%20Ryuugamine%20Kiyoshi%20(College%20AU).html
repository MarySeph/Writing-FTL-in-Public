<h2>Physical Description:<br></h2>
<p>FACE<br>Kiyoshi likes to keep himself prim and proper. His dirty blonde hair is always combed and styled. His self-care routine is as meticulous as well as his make-up.<br>Over his brown eyes, he wears a pair of blood-red classic wayframe glasses. The silver stud on the left earlobe eventually becomes two gold ring-shaped earrings, a gift from his beloved.<br>BODY<br>Kiyoshi stands at a staggering 185 cm tall, the tallest in his high school graduating class. He has a lean body and has trouble building muscle. He diligently used to play soccer up to high school. When he entered college, he stopped exercising in favor of keeping up with his studies at an overseas university. <br>His skin is a golden bronze with a light (tan) undertone. His body is always warm.<br>Hex colors:
- Hair: light goldenrod &amp; goldenrod (FFEC8B &amp; DAA520)
- Skin color: Sunset (FAD6A5)
- Eyes: Coffee (6F4E37)</p>
<p><span>Major: Culinary Arts. ^<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="%255BCollege%2520AU%2520Website%2520Outline.html">[College AU Website Outline</a>]</span></p>
<h2>Personality:</h2>
<p>For the most part, Kiyoshi carries himself peacefully. After graduating high school, he refused to put up faces and act in line with his comforts instead. He’s polite and careful to the point of stumbling over his words. Living in a foreign country, he’s cautious with his words and actions, unsure where he’s allowed to tread. He develops a habit to tense up in social situations so he gives the impression to always be on edge. When he’s comfortable though, like with his roommate, his speech is slow, usually mixing some Japanese. Nevertheless, he’s diligent and hard-working in his studies and duties.</p>
<p>He’s rather shy so he would rather not do things that make him attract too much attention.
When he’s more comfortable with the surroundings, he’s caring and kind. He’s also the type to compliment people’s clothing if he’s close with them.</p>
<p>Kiyoshi values order, habits, and routines. There are times were this causes friction with others, in particular his boyfriend.</p>
<p>Kiyoshi is strict with himself and cares for his private spaces. He struggles with taking risks and getting out of his comfort zone, being spontaneous.</p>
<p>He’s physically affectionate with those that are comfortable with it.</p>
<p>As a highly sensitive person, Kiyoshi absorbs other people’s moods. This means that sometimes he’s grumpy for reasons he doesn’t have control of. His negative moods are silent when he’s around people that aren’t his best friends or his romantic partner. He copes with crying, laying down, and eventually, meditation.</p>
<p>Despite his strict personality, Kiyoshi is lazy. It takes him a lot of energy to do things he doesn’t want to do, even if they are good for him, such as exercise. He does things because he has to, not because he wants to.</p>
<p><span>Kiyoshi describes himself as a fudanshi, someone who enjoys Boy’s Love and takes part in its culture. His first and most beloved OTP is Kaworu x Shinji from Neon Genesis Evangelion; <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="KawoShin.html">KawoShin</a>. While he’s less unhinged seeing two guys being physically close–especially if he knows they are queer–his fudanshi brain still feeds on platonic male bonding, more so if they are absolute strangers. Kiyoshi spent his youth reading BL and grew up with a heterosexual view on same-sex relationships. His same-sex relationship with his current partner promptly challenged that view, so Kiyoshi doesn’t have a bias about them. He could rant about BL for hours, but if someone asked if he was gay through his conversation, he would say he doesn’t identify as such. He does feel attraction to all gender identities but his attraction to male presenting people and bodies is the most prominent. Hence, it wouldn’t be unusual if others thought he was gay. Lastly, he finds the bara genre too explicit compared to BL, and he can’t relate to all the hunks and hypermasculinity-hypersexuality.</span></p>
<p>He rarely eats red meat and has psychological trouble handling it. His diet is based on vegetables, fish, grain, and pastries.</p>
<h2>Skills:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cooking; In a single-parent household, Kiyoshi learned how to cook from a young age. His mom had silent hopes he would enter the food industry and bring him to the hotel she works at. Away from his mother, Kiyoshi’s passion for cooking continues to grow. He finds joy in seeing people share the food he makes and having a good time.</li>
<li>Body kinesthetic; Kiyoshi has good body coordination.</li>
<li>Organization &amp; scheduling.</li>
<li>Written communication; Kiyoshi’s writing hobby supports his proficiency.</li>
<li>Kinetic vision.</li>
<li>Computer smart; skilled using a laptop as everyone his age. After getting a boyfriend, his time on the internet lessened that he hasn’t caught up to current trends. He gets a smartphone as a college student.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hobbies:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reading; When idle, he spends his time reading fanfiction or webtoons online, mostly the NSFW variety. His favorite genre is Boy’s Love or MLM romance. He owns some BL manga volumes in English, including gifts from his boyfriend. His BL/yaoi doujin collection rest at home back in Japan, most of which feature a cute blonde uke. He’s into stories that feature age gap pairings.</li>
<li>Writing; Kiyoshi has developed a journaling habit: After waking up, he sits on the apartment’s balcony and journals everything on his mind before starting the day. While it’s not possible on the days he has an early shift, he tries to do it as often as possible. He also enjoys writing self-indulgent porn and indulging in his sexual fantasies. He has been writing NSFW content since middle school and his safe space is boyxboy/MLM romance stories.
<ul>
<li>Growing up in the now traditional BL/yaoi subculture, his style is derived from its tropes, highly heterosexual with uke-seme dynamics. However, Kiyoshi’s writing differed from non-con/dub-con plots for they tended to be idealistic views of romantic/sexual relationships where the seme knew what the uke wanted and made his wishes come true. The uke was an ideal self-insert and the seme a tool to find emotional comfort and acceptance.</li>
<li>While he has been writing for years, only since starting college he has been using English. His stories have changed along with his mindset, mirroring his experiences. He has slowly transitioned from derivative works to original, his first a series of drabbles between college roommates that physically resembled him and his roommate Lian Yu in yaoi-style. He writes on a laptop and uses smut fiction as a way to destress from college and life, perfectly capable of losing sleep to finishing a draft. His favorite scenario is ddlb with his favorite kinks.</li>
<li>Lastly, he used to have a blog back in middle school where he journaled in public, writing about his chaotic thoughts and feelings and experiences as a teenage boy; they were mostly sad and all names were changed to maintain privacy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sleeping</li>
<li>Trying out new recipes; Kiyoshi uses holidays and events to make something new or improve his skills. Sometimes, he records himself cooking and uploads it on the internet, adding an explanation as if he were teaching others.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Likes:</h2>
<ul>
<li><span>^<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="%255BWestern%2520series%2520Kiyoshi%2520likes.html">[Western series Kiyoshi likes</a>]</span></li>
<li>Fluffy things (stuffed toys and animals); loves to feel them up. Particularly fond of dogs, cats, and rabbits.</li>
<li>Cuddles.</li>
<li>The horror genre; movies in particular because he can hug his boyfriend. He’s not as scared as he seems.</li>
<li>Romance; being in love, loving, romantic gestures, romance songs, reading romance novels. Kiyoshi is all about love.</li>
<li>Pretty things on the expensive side; jewelry and clothing. He holds back from impulse buying.</li>
<li>The Winter season; is his favorite. It includes all the romantic events: Christmas, Valentine’s Day, and White Day. It is also the season to stuff with baked pastries and warm chocolate, cuddling with someone special.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dislikes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Steamed broccoli; will die if forced.</li>
<li>Sexist/misogyny/queerphobic behaviors; Kiyoshi makes it a habit to avoid these people like the plague. Otherwise, he becomes offended and will react.</li>
<li>Crowds and crowded places; the noise and stuffiness overwhelms him.</li>
<li>Reptiles and arachnids; too wet and too many legs.</li>
<li>Otaku culture; he finds it gross. No, Fudanshi isn’t otaku culture. He will not accept otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Gender &amp; Sexuality:</h2>
<p>Kiyoshi has been considering his gender for a long time. When he starts college, he cheaps out and buys the same type of clothes his boyfriend does, dark and muted. This made him uncomfortable for a couple of years until he gathered the courage to search for clothes he liked. Slowly and with the help of his friends and partner, his wardrobe shifts to pastels and pinks. His favorite outfits include a pink hoodie with cat ears, pink overalls on a white shirt, and white shorts. He enjoys modern Asian fashion, particularly Korean-style. He prefers comfortable clothes and sexy ones. He believes his long, skinny legs are rather attractive. In his third year of college, he starts to grow his hair.</p>
<p>Kiyoshi is sensitive about being called a guy, man, and other masculine descriptors. He doesn’t feel like they are appropriate for him. Eventually, he adopts the label “demi-boy.” He prefers what he describes as “soft-masculinity,” a combination of boyhood and cuteness which he tries to reflect in his gender expression.</p>
<p>Kiyoshi is polyamorous. His life goal is to have a family that will include his current partner and raises children. His dream family is to have an amazing wife and two lovely children where everyone gets along. He isn’t sure if he would like to work and be a househusband instead. Between working for pay and housekeeping, he feels more confident in the latter.
When he returns to Japan, Kiyoshi reconnects with a queer friend from middle school, Hikage Tadashi. Hikage is a fashion designer and friend/professional partner of Kei’s childhood friend, Arisugawa Chika. Hikage is enthusiastic about Kiyoshi’s outfit ideas, regardless of payment.</p>
<h2>Current Romantic Relationship:</h2>
<p>Kiyoshi is in a romantic/sexual relationship with Kirishima Keima, his best friend. They have been dating since their 2nd year in middle school and their relationship has been rocky. Keima agreed to follow Kiyoshi to an overseas college, leaving Japan. They oppose each other in many ways which makes them clash often. They do because of their long friendship and trust; they feel safe sharing their emotions with each other, even the small ones. Thus, there are a lot of moments with heightened emotions that eventually get resolved. They know each other deeply and learned to establish boundaries and limits to what they shouldn’t say, finding common ground to discuss constructively. Kiyoshi believes in emotional honesty and that comes naturally to Keima who is blunt with words. As young adults, their arguments are mostly related to establishing new routines, coping mechanisms, and the occasional bad day. They argue because they are different, they learn about those new differences, and they make up by accepting and compromising on those differences.</p>
<p>Throughout their time together, Kiyoshi and Keima have learned how to help each other, their best qualities as well as the nasty ones. They have grown from strangers, brothers, to friends, and lovers. However, no matter how much they change together, they are keenly aware of some things don’t know about each other.</p>
<p>In the relationship, Kiyoshi is the stability while Keima is the spontaneity. Kiyoshi is calm while Keima is in the storm. Kiyoshi brings Keima to the ground and thinks long-term and Keima helps Kiyoshi enjoy the present without worrying about the future and what-ifs.
At Keima’s request, they have a home theatre in their apartment. Keima is an avid fan of motion pictures and video games. Kiyoshi enjoys observing, although he used to play with Keima when they were younger.</p>
<p>Because Kiyoshi enjoys cooking and experimenting with dishes, their kitchen is spacious and well-packed with cooking utensils. Kiyoshi loves to cook and Keima loves to eat his cooking. Both are fond of baked treats.</p>
<p>When Keima learns how to cook, cooking duty is split.</p>
<p>Alcohol-wise, Keima is lightweight while Kiyoshi can handle it well.</p>
<h2>Platonic Relationships:</h2>
<p>Kiyoshi prefers to spend time with people he feels comfortable with. His most important friend groups are his roommate and his partner, and a girl friendship established back in his first year.</p>
<p>With the former, he enjoys small get-togethers where they eat and talk about life.</p>
<p>Back in his first year, Kiyoshi roomed with a one year older transguy named Lian Yu. With Kiyoshi’s accent, he began calling them ‘Rian.’ The language barrier was stressful but Lian made an effort to understand him, and Kiyoshi got used to the language, the instances he used Japanese phrases in their conversations lessened.</p>
<p>Their time as roommates were amicable. Lian answered Kiyoshi’s questions about the culture and society as well as on LBGT+. Because Kiyoshi doesn’t have a bias on biological sex as gender, he didn’t react much when learning Lian was trans. Kiyoshi’s attraction started on day one and grew with time. His flirting was on the shy side and it never progressed from there. He also fussed around when Lian was ill, particularly during periods. In their second semester, Kiyoshi had the chance to cook and brought back food for Lian. Both are soft guys who dislike interpersonal conflict and respect differing opinions. Additionally, they are non-judgemental and stay on their lane. These similarities cemented a relationship based on respect and kindness. It’s not uncommon for them to compliment each other and hug. They have never argued.</p>
<p>Kiyoshi trusts him deeply, asking for advice and confiding in him. Lian was his support during a particularly tough time.</p>
<p>His roommate brings stability to his nervous disposition, helping Kiyoshi ground himself. Both are passionate about food, though his roommate prefers eating rather than cooking.
After their roommate agreement ended, they still texted often and met up. Apart from his partner, Lian is the person that knows Kiyoshi the most. Both are friendly and people-oriented and get along really well. However, Kiyoshi is concerned with his habit of taking the lead around Lian, worried that his friend might be holding back too much. Physical affection isn’t uncommon between them either, although Kiyoshi’s crush twists his perception.</p>
<p>Kiyoshi is also good friends with Lian’s boyfriend, Theo Fanai. Kiyoshi knew him as his partner’s roommate and they had spoken a few times, but they became much closer after bumping into each other at a mall. Theo helped Kiyoshi find some clothes that went according to his gender expression. While Theo was initially unaware of this, his aid meant a lot to Kiyoshi who was insecure and scared for liking the color pink and preferred cuter outfits. Theo introduced him to a Korean brand store where he found some outfits that Kiyoshi fell for at first sight. After this, they texted each other more and learned they share a lot of interests: reading webcomics, make-up, fashion, and Boy’s Love literature. They also talked about NSFW topics like kinks, fetishes, and BDSM, sharing reading recommendations and exchanging information. They are polite and introverted boy-loving boys. They started a casual BL-focused podcast where they talk about the Boy’s Love genre and MLM Japanese media. Kiyoshi also shares the smut fics he’s written he believes Theo would enjoy.</p>
<p>The girlfriend group is always active, cheerful, and intimate. Most of them are culinary arts majors and use some queer identities such as non-binary and lesbian. Relationships, gossip, and relationship gossip are common topics, a habit Kiyoshi was told was the norm between Hispanic girls. Kiyoshi grew to enjoy it, seeing it was treated as a bonding activity rather than having harmful intentions. He’s closer with some more than others and he’s always compassionate, understanding, and gentle. Kiyoshi is grateful to be included in activities he considers ‘feminine.’ They don’t treat him as another or a guy. The group is mostly comprised of Latin American nationals or from immigrant families. By osmosis, Kiyo has learned some words, mostly curse words. They are a loud and cheerful bunch.
The group was established as a cooking club for first years for they wouldn’t start any cooking class until the following year. About once a week, they met up and made a dish big enough to share and receive feedback.</p>
<p>When Kiyoshi sees a friend who feels down, he has a hard time not leaving whatever he’s doing or his priorities and talking to them. He would rather face them one on one and offer emotional support. Thus, Kiyoshi has the habit of putting others’ needs before his, as helping others takes an emotional toll on him and he may not be the best person to help others.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Social Media:</h2>
<ul>
<li>At first, Kiyoshi was ignorant about social media. He learned how to navigate it throughout his college years when he got a smartphone.</li>
<li>Kiyoshi has a <code>Twitter</code>account where he posts pictures of animals, plants, food, and moments with his boyfriend.</li>
<li>His texting habits include emotes, emojis, and kaomoji of the cute and expressive kind.</li>
<li>While he has <code>LINE</code>, he rarely uses it to keep in touch with his Japanese friends and Kei; he doesn’t want to delete it.</li>
<li>Kiyoshi has an account on a popular <code>NSFW writing site</code>where he posts MLM R18 content. Only a select few know of it. The sporadic tags describe the type of relationship in the fic. He writes in both JP and ENG.</li>
<li>He started a <code>podcast</code>with Theo called The Asian Fudanshis where they talk about BL and other MLM Asian fiction.</li>
<li>He has a <code>YT channel named A Japanese Fudanshi</code>where he talks about BL as a Japanese person and cooking videos/practicing certain recipes/teaching.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Occupation:</h2>
<p>Kiyoshi’s first job as a college student was as a baker/pastry chef at a bakery where he interned during the summer. At first, he used to take two shifts, before sunrise and early afternoon. Then, after the workplace got another worker, Kiyoshi took the afternoon shift and did more pastry work. He has the habit to buy the pastries he makes that will otherwise be thrown away, although the bakery eventually gives them to a food charity. Nevertheless, Kiyo does buy his own pastries from time to time and takes them home to share with Keima.</p>
