## What can I cook with these ingredients?

> [! IMPORTANT]
> A **character** and **psychological drama** centered around **human sexuality**. 

^52be92

Or, something more specific. Sexuality-wise:
- Same-sex attraction in a heteronormative society.[^4]
- Gender roles in same-sex relationships born from a heteronormative society.[^5]
- Inappropriate child-adult relationships. (At the intersection, ancient examples (and history) of homsexual relationships. (Research [[Pederasty]]? [[Achilles and Patroclus]]?))[^6]

## What places do I need to write this story?

> [!NOTE] Note
> We are under the assumption some of these characters are **new adults**. But **working adults** are also considered.

- A heteronormative society.[[#^95ba0b]]
- A place for the same-sex gender to meet.
- A place for one the same-sex gender attracted person to realize their feelings.
- People learn about kinks through erotic websites, conversations between family or friends at school or home.
- A school (kindergarten, elementary, middleschool, highschool, and college)
- A house.
- A workplace.

## What events do I need to write this story?
- The interactions between the younger and older character, both non-sexual and questionable.
- Conversations or thoughts about a kink or fetish aka a horny moment.
- Family or friends saying something sexual.
- Family or friends saying something homophobic.








Take each of the characters, events, and places from step 4 and answer: `What do I know about this? What do I not know about this and do I need research them right now?`

Arrange the events in a timeline. Are there any holes? Create more event cards.
