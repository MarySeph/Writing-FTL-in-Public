Kirishima Keima started as a typical male archetype: the protector, the stoic, the cheerful guy[^personality].  ^archetype

[^personality]: [[FULL Kirishima Keima (College AU)#^personality]] 

Dependent on Kiyoshi for this identity since they were little, after they got together, both chose to fit on their already established roles, the masculine and feminine. Kiyoshi was the shorter and sensitive one, the physically affectionate of the two. Keima was the pleaser, letting his partner do whatever he wanted. The first signs of friction showed quite early in their relationship.

Kiyoshi wanted to engage in physical intimacy but Keima pushed back. To him, showing affection to his partner wasn't something he should do.^[[[On Keima and Adhering to Gender Roles]]] Hug, kiss, cuddle. Kiyoshi *must* start these for Kei to do it.^[[[On Keima and Adhering to Gender Roles]]] Proactiveness included answering his partner's demands as well. ^[[[On Keima and Adhering to Gender Roles]]] If he was the actor, it did not seemed appropriate. ^[[[On Keima and Adhering to Gender Roles]]] Keima did not understand the pushback from his body and Kiyoshi suffered as well.^[[[On Keima and Adhering to Gender Roles]]] The blonde did his best to understand, but youth is ignorance and selfish.

There was a breakthrough during one of their sleepovers. Kiyoshi slipped to Kei's futon, startling the latter. They were a couple; they couldn't sleep together just yet. Alarms blared in Kei's mind. By this point, Kiyoshi was starved for affection, balling his eyes out. He loved Keima so much he wanted to hug, kiss, and cuddle. He wasn't crying because he was in pain but because the love he feels had no other way to leave his body. Something changed in Keima that day who finally realized how much his partner loved him. It was the first time he initiated physical intimacy. To him, it was a very important moment.

As time passed, their bodies continued to change. One of the foundations of their relationship began to topple: Kiyoshi was getting taller. This height difference was important for both: For Kiyoshi who wanted to feel protected and comforted and for Keima who had taken the masculine role.^[[[On Keima and Adhering to Gender Roles]]] With their heights changing, their perspectives of each other would change. Kiyoshi's growth spurt was swift, and he hated every second of it. While it was mutual, this document focuses on Keima. In his eyes, being the shorter one meant he was the feminine one, the one that had to be protected.^[[[On Keima and Adhering to Gender Roles]]] Friction marred their intimacy; neither had control over the situation.

They had begun sexual intimacy and Kiyoshi thought Keima being on top would help him regain his confidence. Keima continued to identify as an asexual, and mostly sex repulsed. [^2] They continued sexual intimacy, awkward and bashful, with the little they knew about sex. Keima refused to receive pleasure, their interactions focused on Kiyoshi's.^[[[On Keima and Adhering to Gender Roles]]] Being under someone wasn't something he should do. He should be the one pleasing his partner.^[[[On Keima and Adhering to Gender Roles]]] During this time, they also thoughtfully shared what their roles should be. Kiyoshi was supportive and understanding, putting his best effort in an compassionate conversation. Their relationship started with friendship, so Keima believed he could tell Kiyoshi anything, as uncomfortable as putting his feelings into words made him.[^3]

When they moved to the US, they had only had penetrative sex once. Their first time was Kiyoshi's 18th birthday present which Keima had done plenty of preparations. A key feature they had found worked for him was alcohol: when Keima was drunk, which happened easily, he was bolder. A similar MO was used for their second time as their usual flirtations and intimacy continued at the dorms.

The next change of note was Valentine's Day on their second year. After feeling validated of his two most important identities: masculinity and asexuality, Keima pleased his partner and was willing to start more sexual intimacy. The couple learned Keima like butt stuff more than genitals. Service now explored Keima's new kink.[^service-top]  Kiyoshi had some adjusting to do; he never expected his boyfriend to be into something sexual this much!

Unfortunately, their sex lives didn't become red and roses. With each failure, Keima felt the pressure on him increase. They had tried to diversify their tastes but Keima's reluctance for sexual and physical intimacy still left Kiyoshi relieving himself on his own. One strange tipping point was a gymmate who had developed a crush on Keima and he decided to try kissing. This drove and awkward wedge in their relationship for some time, as both were even and Keima pushed Kiyoshi to release his sexual frustration in what they now recall as a dub-con rape play. Kiyoshi noted Keima prefered being physically punished when he felt he had done a terrible wrong. Another moment of note was during the time Kiyoshi was experimenting with his wardrobe. Kei had a color kink for pink which looked great on Kiyoshi. Kei also found he had an exihibitionist kink. With this new knowledge, their sex lives were adventurous but the root problem was still alive.

Inevitably, Keima caved under the pressure and broke down. Penetration was not his preference and he did not feel capable during the act. This includes his slight erectile dysfunction which he never found a problem until his partner needed it. They decided to seek a sex and couple's therapist. Keima had not shared these feelings of inadecuacy and pressure before this. Kiyoshi admonished himself for putting pressure on his partner while he was free to explore his gender expression. He believed it was okay for him to explore if Keima took on the masculine role. Kiyoshi was the introspective one who learned from past actions and had them more present than Keima, so he shared the troubles Keima had shared to him in the past. They were able to find a connection, the way Keima thought, as a man, he should be. It was this same belief that as a man he couldn't share he was insecure about his masculine identity. Thus, when he felt threatened, he was snappy. His relationship with Kiyoshi wasn't safe from it; Keima felt insecure when Kiyoshi talked to their mutual friends, who Kei knew his partner was crushing on hard. Keima was aware he enjoyed his friend's company when Kiyoshi wasn't around but when he was, they were competition. Keima had left his homeland to be with Kiyoshi. If Kiyoshi looked at someone else, Keima would be completely alone. These feelings also were unshared until the tipping point; it sounded like it was Kiyoshi's fault and Keima was a maiden in love. ^kei-breakdown

Keima had developed strong performance anxiety. Talking with a therapist helped greatly to unravel his thoughts and feelings, and it was the first time he looked back on his life without Kiyoshi's help. He did a lot of crying during this time.

Intimacy-wise, their dynamic changed to mutual pleasure. In their efforts, Keima was clearly not ready to top. Until this point, he had found a few stories that resonated with him: Mentaiko's works, portraying emotional and sexual relationship between burly men and Scum Villaim Self Saving System. The latter, at first it was for fun; Kiyoshi loved the other two worlds. SVSSS's main character resonated with Keima deeply. He was the protagonist of a stallion novel, written as self-insert material for other guys to fantasize about women. Sexual prowress, violence, emotional coldness, power and sexual fantasies, Luo Binghe was supposed to be the kind of guy every guy wanted to be. But the addition of Shen Yuan changed EVERYTHING. When Luo Binghe was treated with warmth by the Shizun who had left abuse against him run rampant, he was both confused and happy. This made Shizun's betrayal much more painful and LBH could not forget about those kind deeds. He feel in love with his Shizun and the emotional pain let the demonic sword take control of him. LBH was in so much pain under the emotions he could not express, one of them being love. This resonated deeply with Keima. When he finished the novel, he himself was in love with what LBH represented, an affectionate, caring, and extremely needy young man.

With Luo Binghe in mind, Keima began to reexamine the ideas he held. He found he felt worthless because he wasn't contributing financially to their household, so he got a job. But he found this job didn't fulfill him. He could pretend getting along with his coworkers but he didn't consider them friends. His true friends were his college mates who were open to non-traditionally masculine expressions. He found an internship related to his studies. On the intimate side, he began to read gay smut and BDSM for ideas. Because he was now the bottom, he considered the idea of taking Kiyoshi and practiced with anal plugs. This high left him blind to Kiyoshi's discomfort. Keima also found he was into dub-con and no-con, and he liked the thought of his gentle and caring partner taking power and dominating him. Keima's adventurous nature was a benefit, these new experiences were the breath of fresh air and invigorated his dusty and stuffy role.

Trying penetration with Keima was a long process. Keima was interested in the experience, being keenly aware of Kiyoshi's size. As the most physically fit one, the pain would be little. However, Kiyoshi was hesitant. He shared he would take time to get adjusted to the top role but the failures hinted the cause was slightly different. Keima had a hunch but it was a topic they had never talked about at length. Each had their reason to not take the first step.

When Kiyoshi decided to open up, the buried past was dug up. It seemed to start a new chapter in their story but it had an abrupt end. Kiyoshi found his answer by himself. Nevertheless, Keima continued to be considerate in bed.

Keima's overconsciousness continued to diminish as he opened up to other people. His erectile dysfunction was caused by the pressure; nevertheless, he didn't get hard as fast as Kiyoshi. Keima was also fearful of orgasm and his partner was delicate and supportive about it. A sex toy helped him maintain the erection during penetration, and there was no shame in that. Kiyoshi was the exception in his friend group and Keima continued to realize every guy was different.

Keima put his newfound confidence in his masculinity to a test when they visited Japan. His mother held beliefs against his relationship with Kiyoshi and his father was rather stoic and supportive about them.
