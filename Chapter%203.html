<p><s>Throughout his life, Kiyoshi has had many dreams. At the age of nine, he wanted to be a veterinarian. At fourteen, he considered becoming a chef, and that same year, he promised himself he wouldn’t stray from his dream to become a professional soccer player ever again.</s></p>
<p><s>At the age of eighteen, none of these dreams had  come true.</s></p>
<p><s>At the age of eight, Kiyoshi dreamed of having a family, just like the one he lost. At the age of ten, he dreamed of being with Keima forever to feel safe from harm. At the age of thirteen, Kiyoshi wished Keima would never get involved with him again so Kiyoshi wouldn’t hurt him.</s></p>
<p><s>Like most dreams, when Kiyoshi stopped running from reality and decided to appropiately call them <em>goals</em>, he put <em>a shit ton of effort</em>into one of them, and at the age of eighteen, it seemed at least one of those <em>might</em>come true.</s></p>
<p>Kiyoshi and Keima were trolling around campus, hands clasped tight. The former giggled, swaying their arms to and fro with a tuneless hum.</p>
<p><s><em>“Lovey dovey hand holding~ Kei and Kiyoshi are holding hands~”</em></s></p>
<p>Keima smiled demurely. With a grin, he pointed out there weren’t many people around. “You haven’t ask to hold hands.”</p>
<p>Kiyoshi gasped, <s>eyes glinting.</s>
<em><strong>[Describe Kiyoshi’s brown eyes under the afternoon sun: a lighter hue]</strong></em>
<s>He stretched his hand.</s>“Let’s hold hands!”</p>
<p>Keima chuckled helplessly <s>and took it</s>.</p>
<p>They turned the corner of the building. A lively crowd had gathered near the tables filled with food and refreshments.</p>
<p>A girl noticed them. “Hello there, here for the International students’ meetup?”</p>
<p>Kiyoshi jumped, nodding at the stranger. Keima’s hand slipped from his. “Ah, hai. Yes, we are.”</p>
<p>The girl took their names and student numbers. “All done! We’ll be starting soon. Come on in!”</p>
<p><s>Kiyoshi plastered a smile as he clung to the fading warmth.</s></p>
<p>——</p>
<p>After the welcome speech, they followed to a roofless, open area.  “Kiyoshi, how are you feeling?”</p>
<p>“It seems like a conmemorative photo. We <em>have</em>—I <em>want</em>to be here,” Kiyoshi pouted.</p>
<p>Kiyoshi fidgeted, looking around as the other students organized for a picture. “Um, can we hold hands? For the picture.”</p>
<p><s>Jade green eyes quivered</s>, lips setting in a thin line.</p>
<p>Keima curled his lips, eyebrows lifting helplessly. Kiyoshi’s stubborn gaze dettered his protests. Keima stretched his hand, conceding to Kiyoshi’s request.</p>
<p>Kiyoshi used the fire from their combined warmth to ground himself. There were twenty or so people closing in, touching each other. Someone touched <em>him.</em></p>
<p>He clutched Keima’a hand like he was suffering a serious injury. Realizing their hands would appear on the picture, Kiyoshi loosed his grip to a more passionate, less crushing squeeze.</p>
<p>One of the photographers spoke. “Thanks for coming everyone! Enjoy the rest of your day! Don’t—”</p>
<p>The people around them erupted into cheers, drowing the speaker’s voice. The bright, late-summer sun illuminated their expressions. Like many other times since arriving to this country, Kiyoshi couldn’t describe what he was feeling. Their unique facial features and unintelligible words vaguely resembled Western films. Yeah, it was like being in a Western film set. The dissapointment that an exciting reality was staged.</p>
<p>The people dispersed. Some left the area while others, forming new groups, chatted or starting to clean up.</p>
<p>“I’m going to look for other Japanese students.”</p>
<p>Kiyoshi clumped his clothes. “I’ll go with you!”</p>
<p>Keima trotted in the same place. He gave Kiyoshi and easy smile. “You don’t have to come with me. I won’t take long.”</p>
<p>Kiyoshi stiffened. <em>“I’ll go.”</em></p>
<p>“Tell me if you want to take a break.”</p>
<p>Kiyoshi and Keima hopped from group to group, introducing themselves to other students. When Kiyoshi reached his limit, they found a seat ways away.</p>
<p>Kiyoshi hunched over, holding his throbbing head. He could still hear the indistinct voices echoing inside his skull. He told Keima he was going inside the building and dragged himself away.</p>
<p>Keima stood up and reached out to Kiyoshi. “Wait, are you feeling ill?”</p>
<p>Kiyoshi shook his head. “I’m going to rest for a bit.”</p>
<p>Keima’s shoulders eased. “Take your time.” He smiled. “You did great.”</p>
<p>The cold air from the indoor air conditioning was soothing. Kiyoshi plopped on one of the couches and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>When his headache lessened, he pulled out his phone, adding the next event to his calendar. Glancing from the top of his glasses, he leaned towards two colorful fliers resting on the table.</p>
<p>One was an invitation to the LBGT club and the other to Bible study. His lip twitched at the irony, recalling his father’s thoughts on Christianity. He took individual pictures of each, sending the first to Keima and both to his dad.</p>
<p>——</p>
<p>On the circular table, three people chatted in half English and half another language. Kiyoshi was frozen on the chair, heart banging against his chest for a way out. Were they in a class together? Roommates? No way he can interrupt a girl’s conversation.</p>
<p>Kiyoshi waited, failing time and time to butt in between silences until his voice rang. “Um, c-could w-we, start the mee-ting. . ?”</p>
<p>The group went silent, turning to him like hawks. Kiyoshi mumbled an apology and lowered his head.</p>
<p>He sweltered as his visiom blurried at th3 edges. Were their burning gazes locked on him, or was it a figment of his overly active imagination?</p>
<p>The one that invited him to the group blurted senseless words. Kiyoshi’s body went stiff. He wanted to dissapear. The leader, due to his silence, turned to the other members.</p>
<p>Somehow, he survived another hour around them. His embarrassing attempts at communicating burned like an open wound. The more he repeated himself, the more his anxiety rose. Every time he opened his mouth, the mood turned awkward.</p>
<p>When he saw the girls taking the nearby elevator, he dashed to the toilet. Stress flowed out of his body like running water, and he calmed down after a few minutes.</p>
<p>His throat and lips ached. On the reflection, his skin was flushed.</p>
<p>Kiyoshi wanted to berate the miserable silhouette that stared back at him. He was doing <em>so</em>well! He felt a little more comfortable in thinner crowds and he enjoyed talking to his roommate every day!</p>
<p>His lips trembled, and hot tears trailed down his cheeks. Kiyoshi repeated his therapist’s words, “Mental health isn’t a straight line, it’s wave. There are bad days as well as good days.”</p>
<p>After clearing his thoughts, his gut bubbled at the memory of his possible future clubmates. He glared at the mirror and straightened daintily. “If you wanted me to help you make a club then at least make a effort to talk to me! You are the leader! You have to learn how to talk to others!”</p>
<p>Taking one of the stone paths, a vast grassland filled his vision. Above, there was a lake. On the horizon were the biggest, prettiest, and fanciest lake houses he had ever seen. Like an eel peeking out of its hiding place, the urge to run down the slope at top speed resurfaced. He imagined the cool air caressing his cheeks, sprinting until his lungs were about to burst.</p>
<p>Kiyoshi tore his gaze away. ‘Focus! Just because I’m having trouble talking to people doesn’t mean I—’</p>
<p>A cat jumped on a nearby table. Kiyoshi closed in, extending a finger towards its glossy black fur.</p>
<p>The cat trotted away without acknowledging his presence. Kiyoshi followed it with a blank expression until it was out of sight.</p>
<p>The way back to the dorm was never-ending. He considered dropping out of the initiative when the smoky shadow spread out. Kiyoshi halted, and with it any gutless plans.</p>
<p>——</p>
<p>Lian’s bright smile and warm greeting were a beacon of light. His nerves disentangled a tad, and he let out a long steady breath. Then, mind catching up to the body, his cheeks flushed.</p>
<p>Lian didn’t show signs he noticed—or chose to ignore it—asking about the meeting with the other Culinary Arts students.</p>
<p>Kiyoshi turned away. “Mn, it was okay.” He dropped his bag beside the bed and promptly fell on the mattress, cuddling the pillow. “Super tired. Many thoughts. Many people.” He sighed through his nose. “Girls. . .”</p>
<p>Lian’s voice felt closer, softer. “Want me to bring you dinner from the caf?”</p>
<p>“Uhn, thank you.”</p>
<p>Lian’s company was like laying on wool. The resistance was just enough to keep Kiyoshi in place. And that fateful day, it was as secure as Keima’s with a marshmallow softness. Perhaps that’s what people mean when saying ‘a mother’s embrace.’ Although to be more accurate, Lian would be an older brother.</p>
<p>They weren’t friendly because they were forced to live together. Lian <em>listened</em>. Lian <em>respected</em>. Lian made an effort to <em>understand</em>him.</p>
<p>Kiyoshi checked his phone for messages from Keima. He was proud of his boyfriend’s newfound passion learning English. Unlike their high school peers, they didn’t study for college entrance exams. Their vacation period was also substantially longer. Kiyoshi was well aware he would burn out if he continued helping Keima every day.</p>
<p>Kiyoshi typed a quick reply about his day, signing off that he would retire early to bed. He had settled under the covers when he heard Lian grumble.</p>
<p>“Ugh, it’s so itchy. Need to get another brand.”</p>
<p>Kiyoshi lifted his head, finding Lian with a patch in hand. Kiyoshi asked if his tummy hurt. Lian kindly answered it was another type of medicine.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, just an allergy. Guess I’ll have to try the T shots.” Lian seemed to say the latter more to himself.</p>
<p>Where had he heard those words? The memory eluded him like trying to catch an apparition from the corner of his eye. His forehead was warm and his brain sluggish as if it had been studying for hours on end. The symptoms weren’t going away until he had a full night’s sleep.</p>
<p>——</p>
<p>Keima stopped in front of him. The corner of his lips quirked upwards, jade green pools warm and cheeky. “Homework at the library now?”</p>
<p>“Mn, I realized Lian was having a hard time focusing on his work, so we’re changing study places.”</p>
<p>Keima pulled a chair and scooted closer as Kiyoshi rested on the table. Their knees bumped. Kiyoshi complained, but Keima insisted on slipping in. Rearranging themselves, they settled face-to-face, legs a tangled mess.</p>
<p>“Cozy, huh?” Keima asked smoothly.</p>
<p>Kiyoshi couldn’t tear his eyes off those thick lips, huffing and puffing from trying the impossible. “A single-person booth is for one person,” Kiyoshi had whined. Even if the standard size was larger, two grown people was cutting it close.</p>
<p>College-related stress dropped like dead weight. In its place, arousal broke out on his skin, aching for contact. He reached the limit in a few seconds, breathing, <em>“Kiss me already.”</em></p>
<p>Keima snorted and tried to pull away. The back of his head thumped against the wood, tearing a groan that passed as a wheeze. “You’re so funny!”</p>
<p>“I’m horny~” he whimpered before deadpanning. “Touch me.”</p>
<p>Keima’s snickers stopped, leaving a loopsided smile. “Tough day, huh?”</p>
<p>“<em>Too</em>tough. There was another meeting for the cooking club to-be. We need to attract <em>more</em>people and find an <em>advisor</em>as well as have a plan. All for the <em>next</em>semester. I’m <em>beaten</em>. And. . .”</p>
<p>Keima repeated, “and?”</p>
<p>Kiyoshi pursed his lips. “. . . Nevermind.”</p>
<p>Keima leaned closer, draping an arm across Kiyoshi’s shoulder. “Good work. I can’t touch you the way you want but. . . we can make out.” Keima’s gaze pulled him in like an ant to a piece of food. Kiyoshi’s hand, hanging onto the table’s edge, moved to Keima’s cheek. His mind melted into the sensation on his lips and Keima’s firm but gentle touch.</p>
<p>When the kiss broke, Keima brushed their noses together. Kiyoshi couldn’t see his face, so he accepted the darkness and focused on breathing.</p>
<p>The grip on the back of his shirt shifted, rousing him. Keima whispered, “I wanted to see you.”</p>
<p>Kiyoshi caressed his boyfriend’s cheek. “Uhn. . . I’m happy to see you.”</p>
<p>Keima exhaled through his nose like a compressed coil that unwinded. Kiyoshi asked if there was something wrong. “No, these aren’t the words I wanted to say. Don’t worry. Say, your birthday’s coming soon. What do you want to do?” Kiyoshi usually had options, but in years like this, he didn’t have an immediate answer. “Do you want to spend it with me? Your family? Maybe we can go somewhere. . .”</p>
<p>The topic dropped for Kiyoshi to ponder over each option. Moving to a larger table, they focused on schoolwork until bedtime.</p>
<p>——</p>
<p>“Rian, if I were to invite (you) to a birthday party. Would you go?”</p>
<p>“Whose party?” Lian hummed.</p>
<p>Kiyoshi felt his cheeks flush. He pointed at himself. “Me.”</p>
<p>Lian beamed, too precious for words. “Oh! Yeah, sure! Is Keima coming too?” He nodded for the sake of the conversation. “We’ll be the same age! Will we? Nevermind, when’s the party going to be?”</p>
<p>“Um, Wednesday, maybe. Two-three. Tw—enty three.”</p>
<p>“Alrighty, lemme know the details!” It was hard to imagine having the same reaction in Lian’s shoes. It did sound like a situation someone more extroverted would enjoy. Heck, Keima wouldn’t even care about the birthday person if a friend invited him. Even so, Lian’s answer made him so happy he was about cry.</p>
<p>——</p>
<p>During the weekends, the cafeteria—with only dorm students and service staff—was thinly crowded. The atmosphere was cozy and welcoming like a hotel on an off-season trip.</p>
<p>From the corner of his eye, Kiyoshi saw Lian waving at a passerby. His roommate pulled a chair, making a grand but friendly gesture as the stranger sat daintily.</p>
<p>Actually, it was no stranger. It was Keima’s roommate, the Korean-looking model. Or at least Kiyoshi would believe he was half-Korean. His make-up was meticulous, highlighting his best qualities. Kiyoshi couldn’t have done his outfit any better. It was the same for Lian, who looked dashing.</p>
<p>Compared to them, Kiyoshi was wearing the muted pieces they bought in a rush.</p>
<p>Seeing the two pretty boys chat, Kiyoshi felt a bone-chilling cold. His vision narrowed to the plates in front of him. The next bites rolled down this constricted throat like pebbles.</p>
<p>Keima cupped Kiyoshi’s fist. Kiyoshi peeked from the rim of his glasses, recoiling at Lian and Theo’s voices. Scrunching his eyes shut, a tear rolled down.</p>
<p>Keima’s eyes shot open. Kiyoshi’s shoulders trembled like thin branches, body curling in itself. Keima rushed to his side, pulling Kiyoshi out of the cafeteria and into the toilets.</p>
<p>A quick peek showed they were alone. The silence was deafening. Rugged breaths and Kiyoshi’s quiet sobs reverberated on the fancy light-colored walls.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I’m sorry.” Kiyoshi wiped the tears that streamed down his cheeks. “I ruined our meal.” When? Why? How? He was enjoying a nice weekend lunch with a loved one and. . . Lian. It was quiet and comfortable. This shouldn’t be happening!</p>
<p>He felt Keima wrap him in a hug. “You didn’t ruin anything. It’s not your fault.”</p>
<p>Kiyoshi choked, burrowing into Keima’s shoulder. “Why am I like this? I don’t want to be. It’s been so hard to talk to people. I cry every day. I’m so scared.”</p>
<p>Keima rubbed his back with a neutral expression, expression twisting. “It’s going to be okay.”</p>
<p>They stood still until Kiyoshi calmed down. Kiyoshi’s curious skin tone was the color of hay drying under the late sunset. Like a broken record, a thought echoed in Keima’s head.</p>
<p><em>‘This appearance isn’t Japanese.’</em></p>
<p>He froze. Then, his face heated up like a kettle, teeth grinding against each other.</p>
<p>“I’m gonna wash my face,” Kiyoshi drawled, strolling towards the basins. “About Rian, I don’t know how to face him—”</p>
<p>“We should go back.” Keima turned away, scurrying to the door.</p>
<p>When they returned to their seats, Lian and Theo, along with their plates, were gone. Another group had taken their place. If Kiyoshi was normal, he could talk and laugh the way they do.</p>
<p>His throat tightened at the sight of his roommate and his companion outside the cafeteria. Lian greeted them cheerfully. It was as nothing weird had happened.</p>
<p>Kiyoshi’s grip tightened. He was so nice. Lian was so so nice.</p>
<p><em>Kiyoshi drama queen moment may ensure. It can serve as a bonding moment between Lian and Kiyoshi, at least through Kiyoshi’s POV.</em></p>
