<p>One afternoon, Keima was strolling around one of the apartment complexes. The surroundings were silent, the breeze warm. On the one hand, he was peaceful. Not seeing people freed him from frustration. On the other, he hated being alone. The fountain in the middle of the benches and bushes was a beautiful place to relax. He should bring Kiyoshi here. More people should be here.</p>
<p>While Keima waited for his boyfriend to finish class, he received a text from an old friend. Lying face-up beside the fountain, they texted back and forth. Soon, the conversation turned into a voice call.</p>
<p><em>“Seems that’s where you should be.”</em>The voice was dim and full of static. Thanks to the silence, Keima could hear the other person crisp clear.</p>
<p>“The hell? No way!” Keima stopped in his tracks and barked.</p>
<p><em>“Our teachers told us to forget about playing sports in college. You got a scholarship in less than a week.”</em></p>
<p>Keima ignored the know-it-all tone, nitpicking another sentence instead. “It’s not set. I need to play in a few games.”</p>
<p><em>“You’ll get the money.”</em></p>
<p>Keima’s expression tightened. “Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>“. . . No. You should think about yourself and Ryuugamine.”</p>
<p>“I have time to think about a friend, Itsuki,” Keima said, lifting the heaviness in his tone. “I don’t know a word of English. I can’t talk to people. If I’m not a bother, lemme talk to you.”</p>
<p>His friend was silent. He was a mysterious fellow of the introverted kind. Soon, a choke echoed from the phone.</p>
<p>Keima’s heart tightened.</p>
<p>His friend spoke.</p>
<p>Listening to Itsuki’s concerns always put his life in perspective. Keima was born with many blessings his best friend and boyfriend did not. He could leave the country and be with the person he loved. More importantly, he didn’t have to live with his overbearing mother anymore.</p>
<p>Keima didn’t want people to ask questions or comment about them. Worst, say their stupid assumptions about their relationship.</p>
<p>Keima wanted to love Kiyoshi and not stand out because of it. This wish was never a pipe dream.</p>
<p>Scratching the back of the head, he paced across the sidewalk. Keima offered his friend words of support. He had little power, money in this case, to help his friend.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Keima complained to his friend that his problems seemed to have followed him from Japan. Compared to Itsuki’s struggles, he found that entire conversation dumb and embarrassing. Moreover, if his English was better, he wouldn’t have motivated Kiyoshi to get involved. He should be able to handle something as simple as being on a sports team. He had done it his whole life, damnit.</p>
<p>After the call, Keima told himself to keep doing his best. He was here with Kiyoshi. Some dumb English homework would not get in the way of his dream.</p>
<p>Sometime later, Kiyoshi sent him a text to go ahead to the cafeteria.</p>
<p>The next time they saw each other was at the dorms. As soon as Kiyoshi opened the door, Keima wrapped him in a hug.</p>
<p>Keima stumbled forward, the click of the door closing behind.</p>
<p>“I was a lazy idiot. I don’t want to waste this chance. I want to be with you. I have to pass these classes for that.”</p>
<p>Seconds passed without an answer from his partner. Keima lifted his head, hand on the small of his boyfriend’s back.</p>
<p>Kiyoshi gazed back with a confused but moved expression, thin lips bashfully curled up as if in a habit. Under the white fluorescent light, his dirty blonde hair shone like the summer sun. His smooth skin was a warm beige, embellished with make-up magic.</p>
<p>His childhood friend would never pass as a Japanese. Unlike him, Kiyoshi was free to love whoever he wanted without consequences.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand very well,” Kiyoshi said, “but I’m glad you found an answer.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the distance between their gazes made his chest ache. He almost missed the quiver in his arms, a squirm like a worm fighting a spider’s grasp.</p>
<p>Waking from the stupor, Keima dropped his arms and put some distance. “Right, the sponge thing. Sorry sorry! Forget what I said.”</p>
<p>Kiyoshi lifted the corner of his lips and turned towards the desk at the other corner of the room. Kiyoshi’s slim figure, clad in muted bottoms and a red shirt, was the only familiar thing in the room. Kiyoshi’s gait was languid, shoulders shifting too far to each side.</p>
<p>“Thanks for yesterday,” Keima said as Kiyoshi slipped into the chair.</p>
<p>The blonde hunched over the desk, one hand on his forehead and the other with a pen. “For poking into your business?”</p>
<p>“Err, yeah.” Keima scratched the back of his head, embarrassed at the echo of his words. Kiyoshi’s words put a damp on Keima’s raging emotions. With a trained eye, he scrutinized Kiyoshi’s body language. He fought the urge to tease him and smooth the tension between them, curling his hands into fists. “Do you want some time alone?”</p>
<p>I don’t want him to look at his homework. I want him to look at me.</p>
<p>“I—um. . .” Kiyoshi frowned, closing his eyes. “I guess I’m tired.”</p>
<p>“You mean my emotions tired you out?” Keima questioned.</p>
<p>Kiyoshi met his eyes, then thought for a moment before nodding. His shoulders softened as he explained. “A lot was going on today. I was already on edge before you hugged me.” His eyes lowered. “I’m sorry I can’t help you today.”</p>
<p>Keima broke into a smile. Even if Lian was there, he wanted to squeeze Kiyoshi tight and burrow his face in Kiyoshi’s soft hair. Maybe pepper his face with kisses too.</p>
<p>Kiyoshi’s exhausted, but he’s still thinking about me. He took the time to tell me what he was feeling so I wouldn’t blame myself.</p>
<p>Despite the fire in Keima’s chest, he held off from touching Kiyoshi because he had reached his limit. He wanted to take care of Kiyoshi, hug him, and cherish him.</p>
<p>“I understand. Don’t worry. Take care!” With those words, Keima left the room, greeting Lian on the way out.</p>
<p>Back in his room, Keima listlessly stared at the blank worksheets on the desk. Hands at the back of his head, he balanced a pencil between his nose and bottom lip.</p>
<p>His gaze drifted around the room until it landed on his roommate. A short, brown man with Asian features on a bed.</p>
<p>Without Kiyoshi, he craved (cross: attention) interaction.</p>
<p>On his phone, Keima opened a translation software. After typing a sentence, he increased the volume and tapped the speaker.</p>
<p>Theo Fanai did not react to the Google Translate voice.</p>
<p>With a grin, Keima approached his roommate’s bed. He leaned in and replayed the question.</p>
<p>[“Can you help with homework?”] A robotic male voice said from the phone.</p>
<p>The man—the size of a boy—looked up from his computer. His yellow eyes narrowed in suspicion. Fanai glanced at Keima’s desk, then back at his face.</p>
<p>With a short nod, his roommate jumped off the bed.</p>
<p>I wanted to bother him, but he was willing to help. Ugh, not fun. He looks shy and easily flustered. Someone who can’t handle unexpected situations or when things don’t go his way. He’s more open-minded and friendlier than he looks.</p>
<p>He was heating up because his prank backfired, not because he was happy someone helped him.</p>
<p>Fanai was a more competent teacher than Keima would ever give him credit for. His prank had become their communication link. The translation wasn’t perfect; it didn’t have to be. By bedtime, Keima finished the work with the assurance it was correct. . . from an English speaking person?</p>
<p>If Kiyoshi and Fanai could talk, then Fanai had to speak English.</p>
<p>. . . Should get Lian to check his homework too.</p>
<p>The following day, Keima was up by sunrise. He stumbled his way to the soccer field while sipping a cup of hot coffee.</p>
<p>Kiyoshi must still be asleep. Man, I kind of want to see his sleeping face.</p>
<p>He felt his face heat up from particular memory. The bitterness from the coffee blended with the sweet sounds of his lover.</p>
<p>Kiyoshi’s birthday approached; the date of their first time. Should he offer the same thing? How was Kiyoshi handling it if they hadn’t done it? To his partner, sex was more important than intimacy.</p>
<p>The hot, bitter drink twisted his features. Their first time wasn’t terrible, but Keima already told Kiyoshi he didn’t care about sex.</p>
<p>Keima sighed and stared down at the cup.</p>
<p>It wasn’t his hazy mind; every sip was terrible.</p>
<p>——</p>
<p>Keima’s mind cleared with the break of dawn, indigo blue watering down to a deep periwinkle. He was the first to arrive, and the Coach greeted him with a barely concealed smirk.</p>
<p>Morning training was simple and easy to understand. Body language was different from speech.</p>
<p>I guess that makes me bilingual, ha.</p>
<p>Keima stayed after training to practice the basics. With the situation resolved, he had the energy to spare. His body craved movement and adrenaline as if he had been in a room for days. Passing the ball between himself a couple of times, he told himself he had to hit the gym later to practice parkour. Or he could find some desolate place with enough obstacles and warm up his tricks.</p>
<p>A voice echoed in the field. Keima turned towards the sound, seeing the Coach moving his mouth at him.</p>
<p>Keima made a gesture and went to get his phone. After opening the app, he spoke to it.</p>
<p>[“This is an English-Japanese translator.”]</p>
<p>The coach looked at him as if he was insane before staring at the phone. Keima pressed the recording button while the man muttered to himself.</p>
<p>“. . . this thing.”</p>
<p>What thing?</p>
<p>He pressed the button as the coach continued. “You don’t have an eight am class?”</p>
<p>[“Classes start at ten.”]</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>[“Can I keep going for another hour?”]</p>
<p>“Sure, I planned to be around for a while.”</p>
<p>Keima smiled, body twitching to bow. [“Thank you very much.”]</p>
<p>He watched the burly man enter the building and sighed.</p>
<p>I forgot to thank him for the scholarship opportunity. After talking it over with Itsuki, it helps Kiyoshi, lifting some pressure off him. He and my parents are paying for everything.</p>
<p>Keima couldn’t imagine failing at soccer. He had received offers throughout his sportsman life, but he had no intention to become a pro. He knew early on in life he didn’t want to work at a company and go to drinking parties while having a wife and child at home.</p>
<p>When Kiyoshi told him he would go abroad for college, Keima wanted to follow on a whim. He was the protagonist, and Kiyoshi’s invitation was a call to adventure. The hurdles that stood in their way were thrilling challenges to his ticket abroad.</p>
<p>Keima believed that with enough time, he could get along with anyone. When he butt heads with the coach, Keima was positive the main reason was that he didn’t know enough English. While he felt helpless over the situation, part of him believed it would resolve itself with time. He was lethargic because there wasn’t something he could do to get immediate results. There was an answer to miscommunication, so there was no reason to ask anyone for help.</p>
<p>It never crossed his mind that he wouldn’t be able to play on the field without Kiyoshi’s intervention.</p>
<p>Feet light and springy, Keima resumed practice. While he dwelled in the past, it drifted to the ‘incident’ that same day. The coach and Kiyoshi were talking when Kiyoshi breathed with difficulty. His round-shaped rich brown eyes a battlefield where neither side would concede victory. Keima’s instincts kicked in, stepping in to separate whatever had upset Kiyoshi. But, the situation diffused before Keima gathered the finer details. Kiyoshi told him the coach wanted to do another trial. After the test, the coach said Keima could receive a sports scholarship if he did well in future games.</p>
<p>——</p>
<p>Weeks later, Keima received the answer he was waiting for. Frustration and helplessness washed over him. The coach stared at the laptop as if he hadn’t delivered earth-shattering news.</p>
<p>It all made sense. The casual offer, the relaxed attitude. The situation was so smooth Keima hadn’t stopped and considered it was too good to be true.</p>
<p>Of course, students had to speak English to be in the team. Those in the intensive English program didn’t qualify to become student-athletes.</p>
<p>“After passing the basic English classes, the department can offer you something.”</p>
<p>From head to toe, Keima’s body was in  <em>flames</em>. He  <em>fell</em>for it.</p>
<p>Contrary to his turbulent emotions, Kiyoshi’s reaction to the news was calm resignation.</p>
<p>Keima couldn’t let the chance go. At some point, that offer was something he could provide for them. He didn’t get it because he was  <em>lacking</em>.</p>
<p>His pride couldn’t accept reality.</p>
<p>“I’ll fucking learn English even if it’s the last thing I do!”</p>
